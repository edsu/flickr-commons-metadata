He was involved in the attempt to introduce salmon to Tasmania and was a member of several European scientific societies. He also took up photography in the late 1850s and is credited with the first wilderness photographs taken in Tasmania, on a trip to Lake St Clair in 1863. Morton and his wife Elizabeth lived in Fernleigh and later Lebrena, both in Davey Street, South Hobart.
