His grandfather had died one year earlier. For the next twenty years he worked hard at his career while coping with family crises and managing the family investments. About 1900 some shrewd investments of his own gave him the means to indulge his interest in Tasmanian history and collect rare books on exploration and Australian history as well as pictures by Tasmanian colonial artists. \n\nTAHO images may be freely used for research or private study purposes.
