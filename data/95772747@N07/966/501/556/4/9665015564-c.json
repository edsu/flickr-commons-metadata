I am not sure about the wind stability, but I would imagine that it would have been quite suitable for handling some of the strongest winds in the World, which has always part of life especially in this part of Greenland. There are at least two benefits to this particular construction, i.e. that it demands a minimum of wood for the frame (two poles and a cross piece), and it is very easily erected.&quot; :-)", "authorname": "National Museum of Denmark", "id": "95751417-9665015564-72157636611591863", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "9665015564"}, "flarchive:created": 1387759975}
