As, however, the Norwegian Police Force in occupied Norway has been considerably reduced and partly Nazified, it has become imperative that Norwegians abroad should train a strong police force, in order to keep law and order during the liberation of Norway. In consequence, 1,500 Norwegians started an extensive training in 3 different camps in Gottr\u00f6ra in Uppland. Later on, more Norwegians were called in and today, 9,500 men are being trained as police in 17 different camps. The training is carried out under Swedish control and partly by Swedish instructors. In some of the camps, training in the use of weapons is being allowed and weapons have been supplied from Swedish stores.Picture shows view from the camp at Thoresta.\n\nRA/PA-1209/Uc/67/3S 5223\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "519", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2012-05-03 22:43:12", "lastupdate": "1374012633", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1336077792"}, "originalsecret": "fa98801787", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7123", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/national_archives_of_norway/7139948905/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
