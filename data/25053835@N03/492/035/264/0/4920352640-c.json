The streetcar on the bridge operated from Lincoln Park through downtown and along Connecticut Ave.then west at Dupont Circle onto P street which was double tracked  from the circle to 28th st. The narrow street grid pattern of most Georgetown streets began west of 28th st. which routed the P street carline west on P st. and east on Dumbarton st.  The carline returned on O st to Wisconsin Ave to Dumbarton st to 28th to return eastbound on P st. to Dupont Circle.\n\nThe conduit streetcar trackage still extant, to the best of my knowledge, in sections of  P and O Steets west of Wisconsin Avenue was originally the western end of the P Street streetcar route. In 1936-37 a major track reconstruction and rerouting project resulted in the elimination of the P Street and Dumbarton street trackage between Wisconsin Ave. and Dupont Circle with service thereafter provided by buses.  The P and O street trackage west of Wisconsin Ave continued to be used until 1960 by the DC Transit Company's route 20 streetcars to Glen Echo Park and Cabin John Maryland.", "authorname": "robspost", "id": "25030781-4920352640-72157625881458393", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/4920352640/#comment72157626077956460", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mrbridge", "author": "12586322@N02", "iconserver": "3015", "datecreate": "1297994698", "_content": "Very interesting details -- I salute you all for your knowledge and interest in the P Street Bridge.
