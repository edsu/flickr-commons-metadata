The greenery and fencing matches the previous photo and the buildings very much match the footprints on period real estate maps. At left is The Cumberland Apartments, built in 1901 and later expanded along the circle. The expansion probably incorporated a pre-existing sf dwelling. Center (DRUGS) is The Clifton Apartments, for which I do not have a permit, which probably means it was a 19-ohs refacing/renovation of the former R. W.
