Corcoran was a prominent Washington banker and philanthropist who found the Corcoran Gallery of Art.  He purchased the house from Daniel Webster in the late 1840s and lived there until his death in 1888.  Corcoran commissioned James Renwick design an addition to the house to accomodate his growing art collection in the 1850s  - later Renwick designed Corcoran's art gallery on Pennsylvania Avenue (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Renwick Gallery).  The house was torn down in the 1920s or 1930s to make way for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce building.", "authorname": "MarisaBJR", "id": "25030781-4920312648-72157624725209579", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/4920312648/#comment72157624726454135", "realname": "George Oates", "path_alias": "george", "author": "34427469121@N01", "iconserver": "1", "datecreate": "1283287437", "_content": "Woo!
