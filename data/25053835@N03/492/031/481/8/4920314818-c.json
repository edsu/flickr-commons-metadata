I remember my mother pointing out one Christmas the White House's National Christmas tree, through the best of the 5 half glass-walled rooms in the children's wing, the one in the middle, with the bed next to the large window.  Although I could barely see the tree it's helped me discover--with your help--where the hospital was located.  Many years later, as a student at the Corcoran, I know that spot is now Ellipse parkland.\nCarol Wallwork\nCentreville, VA", "authorname": "Murlimews", "id": "25030781-4920314818-72157630528434404", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/4920314818/#comment72157631212444216", "realname": "Smithsonian Institution", "path_alias": "smithsonian", "author": "25053835@N03", "iconserver": "2282", "datecreate": "1345752967", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/37658104@N08] Thank you for sharing your story, Murlimews!\n\nSusannah\nSmithsonian Institution Archives", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-4920314818-72157631212444216", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4920314818"}}
