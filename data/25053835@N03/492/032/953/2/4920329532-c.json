The angle of the street in the foreground is that of VA/PA/MA. Those appear to be tracks, so that pretty much makes it Penn. Using period real estate maps and the large institutional building at front/left as a clue narrows the possibilities to 18th &amp; H NW, making the institution the Interstate Commerce Commission and the building in question the Hurley-Wright Building. Indeed, the building permits database indicates that a 12-story concrete, brick, and stone building was erected at 1800 H in 1918, which matches the style. The footprint on the map is marked as being 80 feet along 18th Street, which looks about right.", "authorname": "weliveindc", "id": "25030781-4920329532-72157625194238704", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/4920329532/#comment72157626552947218", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "54010147@N07", "iconserver": "5538", "datecreate": "1303487225", "_content": "At the Library Of Congress we have photos of the building at <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=Railroad%20Adm.%20%20f81\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=Railroad%20Adm.%20%20f81</a>.
