The planetary nebulas shown here are NGC 6543 (aka the Cat's Eye), NGC 7662, NGC 7009 and NGC 6826. X-ray emission from Chandra is colored purple and optical emission from the Hubble Space Telescope is colored red, green and blue. A planetary nebula is a phase of stellar evolution that the sun should experience several billion years from now, when it expands to become a red giant and then sheds most of its outer layers, leaving behind a hot core that contracts to form a dense white dwarf star. A wind from the hot core rams into the ejected atmosphere, creating the shell-like filamentary structures seen with optical telescopes. The diffuse X-ray emission is caused by shock waves as the wind collides with the ejected atmosphere. The properties of the X-ray point sources in the center of about half of the planetary nebulas suggest that many central stars responsible for ejecting planetary nebulas have companion stars.\n\n<b>Creator:</b> Chandra X-ray Observatory Center\n\n<b>Date Created:</b> 10/10/2012\n\n<b>Repository:</b> <a href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sao/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory</a>\n\n<b>Image ID:</b> pne\n\n<b>Permanent URL:</b> <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2012/pne/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2012/pne/</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://collections.si.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View more collections from the Smithsonian Institution.</b></a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "8510", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2013-09-25 09:04:11", "lastupdate": "1381459054", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1380545905"}, "originalsecret": "6b122d7332", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7440", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/9934101373/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
