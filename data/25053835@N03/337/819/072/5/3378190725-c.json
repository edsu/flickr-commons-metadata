The negative/photograph is not dated and we haven\u2019t been able to identify the sculpted bust shown in the photograph.  We can only guess the age of the artist in the photograph.  The artist\u2019s life spanned almost an entire century, but her artistic career blossomed starting in early mid-life.  Born in Mooresville, North Carolina, she arrived in New York City during the burgeoning of African American artistic expression, was a member of the Harlem Artists Guild and involved with the Harlem Works Progress Administration (WPA) project.  In the late 1930s, she studied in France, Germany and Austria and upon return to the United States, received numerous portrait commissions.  In 1940, she opened the Selma Burke School of Sculpture and at age 41 earned her M.F.A. from Columbia University.", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-3378190725-72157616840756411", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/3378190725/#comment72157622331979273", "realname": "Lauren", "path_alias": null, "author": "7711591@N04", "iconserver": "1033", "datecreate": "1253943043", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/473243@N22/\">Historic Heroines</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "rosewithoutathorn84", "id": "25030781-3378190725-72157622331979273", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/3378190725/#comment72157624123508069", "realname": "Aaron Mobley", "path_alias": "avmobley", "author": "8476115@N08", "iconserver": "3728", "datecreate": "1276210463", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1031874@N23/\">Afrikan Portraits (Photographic, Fine Art, Tribal &amp; Scenic)</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Heart of \u00c1frika Designs", "id": "25030781-3378190725-72157624123508069", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/3378190725/#comment72157625192638703", "realname": "Malonda  Richard-Sia", "path_alias": "malondarichard-sia", "author": "40555891@N08", "iconserver": "2638", "datecreate": "1288963925", "_content": "The sculpted bust appears to be a self-portrait since the lips, eyes, ears and hair are a very close match to the artist.", "authorname": "Malonda Richard-Sia", "id": "25030781-3378190725-72157625192638703", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/3378190725/#comment72157629272889586", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11418107@N02", "iconserver": "1068", "datecreate": "1332368054", "_content": "Selma Burke was featured in this set of pins I made about women artists:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/11418107@N02/7004146733/]", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "25030781-3378190725-72157629272889586", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/3378190725/#comment72157629287667288", "realname": "Smithsonian Institution", "path_alias": "smithsonian", "author": "25053835@N03", "iconserver": "2282", "datecreate": "1332531629", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/11418107@N02] Adorable!
