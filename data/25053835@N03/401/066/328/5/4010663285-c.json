The '52 convention was held in New York, and according to the Times, both the band and the Ladies' Auxiliary Drill Team won first place in their respective competitions.", "authorname": "severinus", "id": "25030781-4010663285-72157629061335477", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/4010663285/#comment72157629147827405", "realname": "Smithsonian Institution", "path_alias": "smithsonian", "author": "25053835@N03", "iconserver": "2282", "datecreate": "1328216230", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/32573662@N00] Thank you for sharing this additional information.

We're actually on the 2400 block of <i>3rd</i> Ave S, not 4th.\n\nWhen I found the Tom &amp; Jerry address on 4th Ave and saw that the USPS currently owns the land across the street to the east, I assumed that must be the spot\u2014I didn't actually hunt down the post office's address back then to double-check. But it turns out that back in the day the USPS was at 2401 3rd Ave S, a block west of its current location. So instead of being on the east side of 4th looking west, we're on the west side of 3rd looking east; the Tom &amp; Jerry sign is on the back side of the market. Looks like the USPS sold the property in 1982.\n\nThe hill really should've made me realize my error: West Seattle does rise to the west of this area, but it's much farther off; instead, that's Beacon Hill to the east. The large Liberty Court apartment buildings on top of the hill behind the band (built during WWI to house shipyard workers and still standing today) are another giveaway. Oh well, at least I figured it out eventually.", "authorname": "severinus", "id": "25030781-4010663285-72157629819832091", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/4010663285/#comment72157629840208499", "realname": "Smithsonian Institution", "path_alias": "smithsonian", "author": "25053835@N03", "iconserver": "2282", "datecreate": "1334689438", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/32573662@N00] No worries!
