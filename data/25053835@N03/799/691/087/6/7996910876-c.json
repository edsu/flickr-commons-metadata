While that does seem like one plausible scenario, we actually don\u2019t have a lot of documentation about these two young animals.  The image comes from a photo album that was presented to William and Lucile Mann in honor of their time in the country. William Mann was the Director of the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Lucile Mann was a writer and editor who also <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/7996910672/\">helped care for some of the baby animals</a> on the side.
