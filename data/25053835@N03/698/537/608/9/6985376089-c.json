The following is from the section on the <i>Hannah</i>, which was built in Unalaska in 1898:<blockquote>Originally owned by Alaska Commercial Co. Transferred to Northern Navigation Co. in 1901. Acquired by White Pass in 1914. Not used under White Pass ownership. Abandoned at St. Michael, Alaska in 1917. Demolished by fire at St. Michael shortly after 1944. Had a horizontal, belt-driven electric generator made by A. L. Ide &amp; Sons. This may be the A. L. Ide &amp; Sons unit that is currently on the beach at St. Michael. Boat named for Hannah Gerstle (1838\u20131930), wife of Alaska Commercial Co. president Lewis Gerstle.</blockquote>Also of note, May Kellogg Sullivan's 1902 account <i>A Woman Who Went to Alaska</i> goes into a fair bit of detail of what the 1500-mile trip from St Michael to Dawson City was like on the <i>Hannah</i>; it's <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22409\" rel=\"nofollow\">available</a> on Project Gutenberg; she boards the <i>Hannah</i> on <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22409/22409-h/22409-h.htm#i46\" rel=\"nofollow\">page 41</a>.", "authorname": "severinus", "id": "25030781-6985376089-72157629271383722", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/6985376089/#comment72157629646672443", "realname": "David Rothwell", "path_alias": "rothwell172", "author": "27040583@N06", "iconserver": "8113", "datecreate": "1332458110", "_content": "Outstanding piece of history recognised.", "authorname": "David Rothwell (rothwell172)", "id": "25030781-6985376089-72157629646672443", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/6985376089/#comment72157629287750892", "realname": "Smithsonian Institution", "path_alias": "smithsonian", "author": "25053835@N03", "iconserver": "2282", "datecreate": "1332532519", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/32573662@N00] What a fun anecdote, severinus.
