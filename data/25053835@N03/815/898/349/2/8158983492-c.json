These animals lived in North America long before we did and they have to hunt in order to survive.  Trapping, period, is a horrible &quot;Sport&quot;.  Animals will often chew their own legs off to survive, but, of course, will soon bleed to death.  It may come to the surprise of some people, but fellow mammals feel pain just as we do as we have similar nervous systems.  Just because they cannot talk does not mean they cannot feel pain.", "authorname": "budderflyman", "id": "25030781-8158983492-72157632530385419", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "8158983492"}}
