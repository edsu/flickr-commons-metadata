They are irrelevant to this story and to the Smithsonian photostream.  I mean, come on, the word &quot;standing&quot; as a tag?  What if someone else wants &quot;posing&quot; and someone else wants &quot;living&quot; and some else wants &quot;woman in the background&quot;?  These types of tags are wastes of space and time.  They are meaningless.  It is different if you personally are posting something.  Then you can add whatever tags you want.  But, this is a little different where thousands of people view these images.  Like I said, what if everyone were to list whatever irrelevant tags they want?\n\nBTW, please tell me how the word &quot;standing&quot; as a tag is relevant to you?

Many of my tags are visual descriptions of the photograph and its contents.   I frequently use the images in the Commons for collage work (and I'm not the only one -- these no-known-copyright images are perfect for that purpose, especially if you're selling stuff).  Sometimes I need a more vertical image, sometimes I need a more horizontal image.  &quot;Standing&quot; might be exactly what I'm looking for in a particular project.  So is &quot;bald,&quot; so is &quot;man,&quot; so is &quot;coat.&quot;   Who it is, where it is, those are secondary for such purposes (but I care about those too, obviously).\n\nThere's a pretty generous limit on the tags in the Commons.  If they're getting close to that limit, then there might be a reason to comb through them and make some decisions about which to keep.  Until then, for some of the Commons users, the tags I add are relevant.  For others, other tags are relevant.  Part of the Flickr Commons project, to my understanding, is finding out what different groups of users are out there, and what they want.", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "25030781-4325240926-72157624076740872", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/4325240926/#comment72157624086383972", "realname": "Smithsonian Institution", "path_alias": "smithsonian", "author": "25053835@N03", "iconserver": "2282", "datecreate": "1274188126", "_content": "We are happy to have tagging activity on the photos.
