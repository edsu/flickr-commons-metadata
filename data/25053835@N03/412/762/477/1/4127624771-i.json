Optical data from the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope and the Digitized Sky Survey shows galaxies in the cluster (yellow). Detailed analysis of the Chandra data shows that the gas located along the direction of the radio jets is enhanced in iron and other metals produced by Type Ia supernova explosions in the large galaxy at the center of the cluster. A powerful outburst from the supermassive black hole then pushed the material outwards, over distances extending for almost 400,000 light years, extending beyond the region shown in this image.\n\n<b>Creator/Photographer</b>: Chandra X-ray Observatory\n\nNASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, which was launched and deployed by Space Shuttle Columbia on July 23, 1999, is the most sophisticated X-ray observatory built to date. The mirrors on Chandra are the largest, most precisely shaped and aligned, and smoothest mirrors ever constructed. Chandra is helping scientists better understand the hot, turbulent regions of space and answer fundamental questions about origin, evolution, and destiny of the Universe. The images Chandra makes are twenty-five times sharper than the best previous X-ray telescope. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., manages the Chandra program for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory controls Chandra science and flight operations from the Chandra X-ray Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n<b>Medium</b>: Chandra telescope x-ray\n\n<b>Date</b>: 2009\n\n<b>Persistent URL</b>: <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/hydra/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/hydra/</a>\n\n<b>Repository</b>: <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory</a>\n\n<b>Gift line</b>: X-ray: NASA/CXC/U.Waterloo/C.Kirkpatrick et al.; Radio: NSF/NRAO/VLA; Optical: Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope/DSS\n\n<b>Accession number</b>: hydra_434"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3213", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-11-23 10:34:53", "lastupdate": "1378456259", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1259072846"}, "originalsecret": "099d69cc6f", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2720", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/4127624771/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
