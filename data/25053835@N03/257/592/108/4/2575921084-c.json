Here's a little more about cyanotypes. You can find more descriptions of phtoographic media in our search- <a href=\"http://photography.si.edu\">photography.si.edu</a>\n\nCyanotype \nSir John Herschel invented the process for printing a cyanotype\u2014more commonly known as a blueprint\u2014in 1842. Creating a cyanotype involved developing prepared paper with an iron-salt solution. After treating the paper with ferric ammonium citrate and potassium ferriyanide, a photographer would place a negative, or even a drawing, on top of it in direct sunlight, causing the exposed parts of the paper to turn bright blue from the effects of the iron. Subsequently submerging the print in water caused the image to become fixed and the unexposed chemicals to wash away, and the iron\u2019s oxidation caused the blue image to intensify. Engineers and architects favored this process for copying drawings because it was stable, efficient, and inexpensive. Thomas Smillie, the Smithsonian\u2019s first photographer, employed this printing method to keep track of his glass-plate negatives. He made and cataloged cyanotypes of each image, after which he stored the corresponding glass-plate negative.", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-2575921084-72157605661691142", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2575921084/#comment72157608722369617", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1226025147", "_content": "S.
