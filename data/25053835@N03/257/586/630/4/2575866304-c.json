Most likely the edition was the one sold and imprinted for an American market by J. W. Bouton, 706 Broadway, New York. The first edition was dated 1839, but page 575 of this later addition matches the picture exactly. The globe would have been filled with water and a bit of cobalt (to make the light less glaring). The globe worked like a bull's-eye lens, concentrating the light into a small area, and enabling the engraver to work at night. The globe would have also acted as a buffer from the heat of the lamp. Several engravers could work around a single light by using the globe set-up between the lamp and their work surface.", "authorname": "typesticker", "id": "25030781-2575866304-72157628021388723", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2575866304"}}
