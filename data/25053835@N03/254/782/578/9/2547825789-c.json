Ferdinand Friend was in business in 1880-81 as Friend and Owen, at 244 &amp; 246 Woodward. Owen isn't listed in 1883 - but the address is still 244-46 until 1884. In 1884 its only 244 Woodward, and It stays like that until at least 1890. If you blow uo the photo you can see that she isn't holding a gun - although it does look like it. The loop around her thumb is cloth - a handkerchief or scarf, that drapes over her hand. Above it is a rectangular object that might be a book, wallet, or even her eyeglass case.", "authorname": "patiencenauta", "id": "25030781-2547825789-72157626223048457", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2547825789/#comment72157628703229833", "realname": "", "path_alias": "belleislehome", "author": "33430073@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1325619889", "_content": "I wrote about her on my blog, if you want to know more about her family, painting, and travels in Europe.
