It was drawn on very thin paper (it is begining to desintigrate) and backed by canvas. The signature looks like &quot;elliot&quot;, so im hoping it is a C.L. Elliot. Can anyone help me identify it? susie.bergquist@gmail.com i will email you the photo", "authorname": "supersuzee", "id": "25030781-2548290932-72157625881771122", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2548290932"}}
