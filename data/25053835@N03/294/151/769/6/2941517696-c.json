X-rays are still &quot;light&quot;, but of course are not within our visible spectrum. However, they still have various types of wavelengths and can then program the computer to code in a certain way. I don't know of course exactly what their decisions are in regards to this, but in general that's how it's done when you see color photographs of space that show non-visible wavelengths (thus, color &quot;coding&quot;).", "authorname": "Krista", "id": "25030781-2941517696-72157608400109200", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2941517696/#comment72157608457291771", "realname": "Claudiu  Balaceanu", "path_alias": "claudiu_balaceanu", "author": "30004257@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1225221466", "_content": "You're right. However, I would feel really bad knowing that the scientists have altered the pictures that they've been taking from the depths of space just for the sake of making them more.. cool! I am sure science will reach new levels in the future and we will be able to make sure about the colours of the gas clouds, and so on. I'm still waiting for the science to advance, whilst being happy with the things we have now, even if not always COOL !\n\nBye bye\n\nps: 'and by the way, I am not reffering in ANY way to &quot;mcritzman&quot; 's comment.

That\u2019s because the colors used to make them are not real but are chosen to bring out important details. The color choice is typically used as a type of code in which the colors can be associated with the intensity or brightness of the radiation from different regions of the image, or with the energy of the emission.  At <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/false_color.html\">chandra.harvard.edu/photo/false_color.html</a>  you'll find a detailed description of representative, or &quot;false&quot; color for invisible wavelengths such as X-rays.", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-2941517696-72157608624770491", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2941517696/#comment72157610590300182", "realname": "", "path_alias": "applejuices", "author": "15166070@N00", "iconserver": "6164", "datecreate": "1228132476", "_content": "fascinating!
