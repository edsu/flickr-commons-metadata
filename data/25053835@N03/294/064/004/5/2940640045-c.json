Your image shows lines of longitude and latitude from the geographic north pole. If the magnetic north pole was added to the image, then the pattern of the aurora would make more sense, as it appears to lie in an arc at a constant radius from the pole.", "authorname": "Picture Esk", "id": "25030781-2940640045-72157619871073559", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2940640045/#comment72157621828758909", "realname": "Kimberly  Arcand", "path_alias": null, "author": "87348492@N00", "iconserver": "133", "datecreate": "1249484113", "_content": "Thanks for the interesting suggestion.
