We look at a picture taken at the hospital the first day and declare the baby in the picture as &quot;newborn&quot; regardless of how long it took the post office to deliver the picture. Assuming a fixed time for delivering the mail, a picture received a year later will show me a one-year-old (though, in fact, by the time we get the picture the child may be a week older than that). If we watch the child grow up entirely through pictures received in the mail, it doesn't really matter how long the mail delay is (as long as it is always the same); we can simply track the age by the day on which we receive the mail.", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-2940666879-72157616462056401", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2940666879/#comment72157622270807735", "realname": "", "path_alias": "duiceburger", "author": "22411407@N05", "iconserver": "5330", "datecreate": "1253190990", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1238524@N23/\">NASA - Public Domain</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "duiceburger", "id": "25030781-2940666879-72157622270807735", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2940666879/#comment72157623392640018", "realname": "Jouni Tyrisev\u00e4", "path_alias": "jouni", "author": "67991523@N00", "iconserver": "128", "datecreate": "1265754590", "_content": "Impressive!
