Was curious myself, so I pulled my colleagues into the inquiry. From their collective and impressive knowledge of Smithsonian history, we deduced the following: \n\n\nThe \u201cStatue of America\u201d also known as the \u201cGoddess of Liberty\u201d or \u201cLiberty\u201d was erected in honor of President James Garfield\u2019s inauguration, held at the United States National Museum (now the Arts and Industries Building). The March 4, 1881 celebration was the first event to take place at the USNM. According to the 1881 Smithsonian Annual Report, the statue was described in the following notation: \u201cdecorations prepared by the committee consisted of a colossal statue of Liberty, erected in the rotunda.\u201d The \u201cStatue of America\u201d was created by artist Casper Buberl, who also created the statue Columbia Defending Science and Industry which is located on the exterior of the USNM\u2019s north entrance.\n\nWhen the USNM opened for the inauguration, the floors were not complete. To be available for the event, temporary wooden floors were put in place. Shortly after the inauguration, \u201can appropriation of $26,000 was made by Congress for covering the four halls with marble tiling and the rotunda with encaustic tiling. The introduction of a fountain basin, 20 feet in diameter, in the rotunda, greatly reduced the amount of tiling to be done, and added much to the general effect. It is proposed to have a small fountain jet in this basin, and to have various ornamental plants growing in it, forming a pleasing prospect in looking across the long extent of over 300 feet from one main entrance to another.\u201c (page 10)\n\nConsequently, it seems that the \u201cStatue of America\u201d was a temporary structure inside the USNM, and was taken down when the temporary wooded floors were dismantled and replaced by the permanent marble tiles. \nIn 1890, the fountain in the USNM\u2019s rotunda was replaced by the \u201cStatute of Freedom,\u201d a plaster model of the statue that stands atop the US Capitol Building. This model remains in the USNM rotunda until 1967 when it too is replaced by a fountain. \n\n\nAs for the current location of the \u201cStatue of America\u201d that is unknown. However, I was presented with another lead, so please stay tuned!  \n\n\nSusannah \nSmithsonian Institution Archives", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-3199223526-72157629236278409", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3199223526"}}
