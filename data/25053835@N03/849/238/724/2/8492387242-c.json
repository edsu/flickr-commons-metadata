We double-checked the caption supplied by Lockheed which says clearly: \u201cShe is active in the Astronautical Society of the Pacific\u201d.  She was, indeed, active in the \u201cAstronomical Society of the Pacific\u201d (plenty of evidence of that in JSTOR) but there is also an organization (in which, given her employment at Lockheed, she  is also likely to have participated) called the \u201cAmerican Astronautical Society.\u201d  So, it is probable that the public relations office at Lockheed either conflated the two societies or misunderstood what she told them.  We have added [sic] to the caption to reflect that. \n\nEffie, SIA", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-8492387242-72157633093804521", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/8492387242/#comment72157634284023763", "realname": "Archivist Llewellyn", "path_alias": null, "author": "35047286@N02", "iconserver": "3776", "datecreate": "1372013713", "_content": "Please consider adding this photo to the pool &quot;50th Anniversary of Women in Space&quot; <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/womeninspace/pool/\">www.flickr.com/groups/womeninspace/pool/</a>.", "authorname": "Archivist Llewellyn", "id": "25030781-8492387242-72157634284023763", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "8492387242"}}
