Peterson</i> s/b Petersen.\n\n<b>Grace Agnes Petersen</b> (d.1960) was a mycologist, and an instructor in Natural History. In 1926 she received a B.S., and in 1937 an M.S. from Cornell University.

Along with her professional papers, Grace also published a book of <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Sea_Foam.html?id=dBBAkwEACAAJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">poems</a>, <i>Sea Foam</i>, which she also illustrated.

She would lead occasional botanical and zoological trips, as well as nature hikes and adventures in New York Parks on some Saturdays.\n\nFrom 1944-1960 she spent thirteen summers as a nature counselor at <a href=\"http://www.northropcamp.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Northrop Camp</a>, in the Berkshires (Massachusetts) which provides New York City girls and boys, whose families could not otherwise afford camp, the opportunity to learn about nature and the environment. She wrote a <a href=\"http://www.northropcamp.org/people/petersennewhorizons.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">touching article</a> entitled &ldquo;New Horizons&rdquo;, about her beliefs in teaching Nature Study to city children, as well as her experiences at Northrop, in the May/June, 1945, issue of <i>Audubon Magazine</i>.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Below:</i> A happy group of campers \n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at Camp Northrop.

My first project was on useful wild plants and my second . . . was on identifying wild flowers. These projects extended into a lifelong hobby and career.  Dr. Grace Petersen was the very dedicated nature director during my camp days. &nbsp;She . . . was the first person to show me a slime mold . . .  Later in college I found that one of my biology teachers, . . . did his research on slime molds. Since my curiosity was already aroused, I carried out undergraduate research with him, got a Master's in botany, and a Ph.D. in microbial genetics . . . &rdquo;</i> &nbsp;&mdash; A camper, 1954 and 1956, now a botanist and microbiologist living in New Jersey.</blockquote>\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "25030781-8492334172-72157633023061779", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "8492334172"}}
