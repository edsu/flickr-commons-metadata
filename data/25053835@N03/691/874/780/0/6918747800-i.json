Multimillion-degree gas detected in X-rays (blue) by the Chandra X-ray Observatory comes from shock fronts formed by these stellar winds and by supernova explosions. This hot gas carves out gigantic bubbles in the surrounding cooler gas and dust shown here in infrared emission from the Spitzer Space Telescope (orange).\n\n<b>Creator/Photographer:</b> Chandra X-ray Observatory\n\nNASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, which was launched and deployed by Space Shuttle Columbia on July 23, 1999, is the most sophisticated X-ray observatory built to date. The mirrors on Chandra are the largest, most precisely shaped and aligned, and smoothest mirrors ever constructed. Chandra is helping scientists better understand the hot, turbulent regions of space and answer fundamental questions about origin, evolution, and destiny of the Universe. The images Chandra makes are twenty-five times sharper than the best previous X-ray telescope. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., manages the Chandra program for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory controls Chandra science and flight operations from the Chandra X-ray Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n<b>Medium</b>: Chandra telescope x-ray\n\n<b>Date</b>: 2011\n\n<b>Image ID</b>: 495\n\n<b>Persistent URL</b>: <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2011/30dor/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2011/30dor/</a>\n\n<b>Repository</b>: <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory</a>\n\n<b>Gift line</b>: X-ray: NASA/CXC/PSU/L.Townsley et al.; Infrared: NASA/JPL/PSU/L.Townsley et al.\n\n<a href=\"http://collections.si.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View more collections from the Smithsonian Institution.</b></a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "5769", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-06-29 16:42:03", "lastupdate": "1339381370", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1334152856"}, "originalsecret": "55ebb67ecf", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5039", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/6918747800/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
