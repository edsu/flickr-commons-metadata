According to the Commission de toponymie, <a href=\"http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=215058\" rel=\"nofollow\">Margaret Street (later rue Ste-Marguerite) was renamed Sainte-C\u00e9cile in 1907</a>, around the time when Saint-Henri was merged with Montreal, given that Saint-Henri already had a rue Sainte-Marguerite. This photo looks like it was taken with the photographer standing just north of Saint-Antoine Street. All of this area today lies within the footprint of the 1000 De La Gaucheti\u00e8re office tower. There is a small stub of rue Sainte-C\u00e9cile left between Saint-Jacques and Saint-Antoine Streets.", "authorname": "Antonio Iacovelli", "id": "25694016-2851049076-72157629989469035", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "2851049076"}}
