The person who had the copy made in 1920 was Henry Gifford Birks, son of  William Massey Birks and Miriam Childs Gifford. William was the son of Henry Birks, the originator of the jewelery store, so these people are quite likely to be Birks family members. From the ages of the four people in the photograph, I would suspect it's a 4-generations portrait.\n \nThe original image looks as if it was taken in the 1890s, and Henry Gifford Birks may have been the second son born after William married Miriam in 1891. If he's the baby, the older woman might be his paternal great grandmother Anne Massey, or his maternal great grandmother. Presumably one of the younger women is his mother, Miriam Childs Gifford, and the other his paternal grandmother Harriet Phillips Walker (died 1925) or perhaps his maternal grandmother. The oldest woman is wearing widow's weeds, so I presume she has lost her husband within the last 2 years.\n \nHowever, the baby might be his brother Gerald Alfred Birks, who may have been the first-born of the siblings. Since Henry had it copied, I would suspect he himself is the baby.\n \nHenry Gifford Birks had another generational photograph copied, <a href=\"http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/collection/artifacts/II-234113.0\">II-234113.0</a>, containing different women, a different baby, and a man who resembles one of Henry Birks' three sons, see <a href=\"http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/collection/artifacts/II-111126\">II-111126</a>.\n \nSpeculation is a wonderful thing.\n \nNora", "authorname": "Mus\u00e9e McCord Museum", "id": "25694016-3294656277-72157615553010449", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/museemccordmuseum/3294656277/#comment72157615645882784", "realname": "Stephanie Fysh", "path_alias": "lu_", "author": "61361160@N00", "iconserver": "5330", "datecreate": "1237499201", "_content": "It is indeed - thank you for putting so much time into this!", "authorname": "L\u00fa_", "id": "25694016-3294656277-72157615645882784", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/museemccordmuseum/3294656277/#comment72157616060361623", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anjoudiscus", "author": "7186636@N06", "iconserver": "3695", "datecreate": "1238469516", "_content": "Magnifique !", "authorname": "anjoudiscus", "id": "25694016-3294656277-72157616060361623", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/museemccordmuseum/3294656277/#comment72157623934067357", "realname": "Cl\u00e1udia Helena", "path_alias": "claudiahelena", "author": "19167248@N02", "iconserver": "3098", "datecreate": "1273836758", "_content": "Perfect!", "authorname": "* Cl\u00e1udia Helena * brincadeira de papel *", "id": "25694016-3294656277-72157623934067357", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/museemccordmuseum/3294656277/#comment72157630753706260", "realname": "Michael", "path_alias": null, "author": "26763602@N08", "iconserver": "8240", "datecreate": "1343266976", "_content": "Yeah that's not 1920 ..
