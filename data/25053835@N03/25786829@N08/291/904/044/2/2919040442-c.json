It is definitely taken from a higher elevation than the hotel; it might even be a bit further up Burrard, and/or back towards Thurlow. If we knew the lens that Notman used in this photograph, we could perhaps more accurately estimate the distance.", "authorname": "jmv", "id": "25694016-2919040442-72157630933679880", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2919040442"}}
