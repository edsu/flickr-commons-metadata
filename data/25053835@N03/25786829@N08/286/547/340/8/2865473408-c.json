I am a psychic and as well my daughter, we both felt the presence.

As to the other presence there are 2 males that feel to be quite cordial :)\n\nSaffire", "authorname": "Saffire-Visions2005.com", "id": "25694016-2865473408-72157622638214285", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/museemccordmuseum/2865473408/#comment72157627998158320", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "34918130@N07", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1319823750", "_content": "Great Photo of an old, Historical place.
