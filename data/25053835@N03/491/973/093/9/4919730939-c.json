Its original name was Memorial Evangelical Lutheran Church and it was designed by architects Judson York, J.C. Harkness, and Henry Davis. It is located at 14th Street and Vermont Avenue NW, at Thomas Circle, in Washington, D.C., near its namesake, a statue of Martin Luther.\n\nThe first photograph shows the church during construction, c. 1870. &nbsp;In 1904 (15 years before the second photograph was taken), Luther Place suffered damage from a fire, leading to restoration of the church and a renewed energy and celebration of its mission. President Theodore Roosevelt spoke at the restoration ceremony in 1905.\n\nSince 1904 little has changed to the exterior of the church, albeit the surroundings and Thomas Circle have changed dramatically. There was a recent restoration of the church interior, and the church is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
