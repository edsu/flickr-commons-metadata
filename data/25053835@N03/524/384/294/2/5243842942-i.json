In 1910 he established his Thule station at Cape York, Greenland, the base for seven expeditions, five led by Rasmussen himself. Rasmussen was an excellent explorer, interpreter, and translator. He documented many Inuit legends that may have gone unnoticed without him. His work helped future explorers and he will always be remembered as the first man to cross the Northwest Passage by dog sled. He made a visit in 1924 to Washington, D.C., with several of his expedition companions. The visit was documented by Science Service, a news service established in 1920, which also publicized his expeditions\n\n<b>Summary</b>: The Skongen, the Danish Fifth Thule Arctic Expedition's ship, is making slow progress through ice covered Hudson Bay\n\n<b>Place</b>: Canada\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hudson Bay\n\n<b>Persistent URL</b>:<a href=\"http://siris-sihistory.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!sichronology&amp;uri=full=3100001~!11493~!0#focus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link to data base record</a>\n\n<b>Repository</b>:Smithsonian Archives - History Div\n\n<a href=\"http://collections.si.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View more collections from the Smithsonian Institution.</b></a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2546", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-12-08 07:05:41", "lastupdate": "1328141031", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1291809941"}, "originalsecret": "a852468607", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5086", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/5243842942/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
