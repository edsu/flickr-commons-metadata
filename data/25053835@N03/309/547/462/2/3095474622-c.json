Rather, as a servant, one of his duties was that as a gun bearer, as mentioned in a previous comment.  While both guns shown are being used as props for this staged photo, the young man probably carried that very gun and others many miles over his life for Mr. Stanley and others.\nHistorically, it was quite common for a white man to teach a young servant like this to shoot as well.  In this photo, both of these guns are likely either single or double barreled rifles.  Repeating rifles of large enough caliber to kill dangerous African game ranging from lions to elephants simply did not exist at this time.\nTherefore, having a servant (or a few) who knew how to shoot could come in quite handy in life-threatening encounters with wild game.\nI agree with your assessment of the treatment of Africans by whites, but will point out that it is a fact that young men like this were often trusted with loaded weapons, just as some African slaves in America (also most often young boys) were trusted to perform similar duties for Southern plantation owners, toting their shotguns and extra ammunition during quail hunts.\n\np.s. Foreignobesessed, I can't, for the life of me, grasp whether or not your comment is supposed to be sarcastic, racist, or what.

From what I have read, the egos of these European &quot;great white hunters&quot; likely didn't lead to them using servants to kill dangerous game.  However, I would bet that on more than one occasion, a servant probably saved the life of Stanley and those like him.  They likely were also dispatched to hunt small game for table fare for the white men.\n\nAn interesting read is &quot;The Last Ivory Hunter&quot; by Peter Hathaway Capstick.  While his behavior might be perceived today as racist by some, he didn't see it that way.  He writes &quot;...They weren't lesser people, of course--just different from their white fellow countrymen when it came to way of life and values.  Much in the way that a Japanese businessman differs from a Finn in how he views the world and what he considers important&quot;.\n\nIn this book, which can be found in it's entirety on Google, the author also speaks of the salary which he paid his head gun-bearer, who left after being given a raise after 20 years of employment.  The &quot;bush logic&quot; this man used told him that if he received a raise, it must have mean that he had been worth the greater amount for his previous years of employment, and he was upset that he had not been paid his full worth from day one.", "authorname": "Topato", "id": "25030781-3095474622-72157616098170413", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/3095474622/#comment72157616411077030", "realname": "", "path_alias": "island_life", "author": "24446691@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1238995899", "_content": "I see evil and corruption when I look at that &quot;white man&quot;... :(", "authorname": "Island-Life", "id": "25030781-3095474622-72157616411077030", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/3095474622/#comment72157616514997735", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nixsands", "author": "28952136@N06", "iconserver": "3153", "datecreate": "1239415235", "_content": "Find out the facts, then comment.

Staged photos like this in the late 1800s were used to illustrate news stories and distant cultures because technology did not allow for on the spot authentic recording of visual images. While artists could depict events with pen and carvings, photography was an irresistable new instrument for journalists seeing the possibility of authenticity instead of artistic interpretation. The transition was awkward, as seen here.\n\nThis is one of the baby steps on the way to modern photojournalism. \n\nI find some of the comments here ridiculously out of context for the time and events and locale represented. We cannot judge the quality of this photo in terms of today's technology, nor should we judge the race relations among peoples who had just discovered each other in terms of today's environment where we grow up together as neighbors, and even as family members. It didn't take long for humanity to reach this point, considering the thousands of years of war, conquest and slavery prior to the days of this photo. \n\nWe owe the turning point that changed all of our lives to men like Livingstone and Stanley. L's life and S's writings brought empathy and compassion into the picture, replacing hatred, exploitation and dehumanizing beliefs. These were important baby steps that we must understand and appreciate for their historical significance - not ridicule and judge harshly from today's perspective.\n\nI find humor in this picture, even if it wasn't intentional. I think of the progress of both photojournalism and race relations in the short few generations between then and now.

However, to stay in a place where you are not welcome is not right, and, historically, cannot last long. For instance, we are no longer welcome in Iraq or most of the Middle East; and everyone knows we are just hanging around for the oil. For the English, it was the slaves, ivory and gold. In this day and age, to defend colonialism is a bit backward looking, and false history. If you ask an Englishman if he thinks colonialism was good, you are bound to get a mixed answer. If you ask a native of a colonized country that was invaded and oppressed by the English, you are bound to get another answer. Naturally, history's reality depends upon perspective. One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter. Little black boys and grown white men do not belong with one another in any intimate setting, though they sure seem to have in the past. Finally, there were plenty of whites who thought colonialism was wrong during the past, yet there voices were few or suppressed. The point? Claiming it is hard to pass judgement on those in the past from our time vantage point  is simple not true; many educated people knew slavery and colonialism were evil prongs of the same snakes tongue. Final point; those who defend colonialism are often descended from the old oppressors and, therefore, benefitted (some greatly) from that oppression and must justify the historical oppression in order to justify their current existence.

To me, the human subjects in the photo are mere representations of  people coming from 2 very different cultures. I don't see any reason for me to perceive it as something more than that. On the other hand, a person who is overly sensitive to whatever implications a picture may project, might be hasty to judge it as racist. Nevertheless, as I've pointed out in my previous post, there really was no reason in the photo for one to make such a valid conclusion--and that was all I was really trying to say.\n\nAbout your comment that &quot;little black boys and grown white men don't belong together in an intimate setting&quot; might have been a bit simplified, as I'm sure you won't have a problem seeing a picture of a grown white expeditionist posing with, say, an Inca boy.  It sounded like you were saying that racial tension existed merely between the white and the black race, but I'm quite certain that is not the case.\n\nAs I've said before, I am sure there were a lot of cases of racist abuse commited by colonizers back in the era of colonization. Nevertheless, even the most &quot;unfair&quot; of colonists had a great deal of good to contribute to the colonized peoples as a whole, such that they eventually were better off for it.

There are heinous aspects to all societies.  Slavery exists in all parts of the world in some form or another.  It may not be as prevalent today as it once was. However it flourishes in many forms from endentured servitude to sexual crimes against kidnapped victims.  Children are quite often the victims.  I believe that Stanley found himself in places and times where it was only the character and conscience of his guides and servants that allowed him to survive.  I believe he understood the efforts and sacrifices his hired men made for him to complete his adventures.  History is filled with outrageous stories of the goings on during explorations and discovery missions.  Sir Francis Drake had to deal with mutiny and the hardships of leading a group of men on a wooden vessel around a little known world.  He hung some of his men from the yard arm to keep his ship afloat.  A story is told of a navy ship from El Salvador coming to port in Hawaii in 2001 and one of the crew was caught stealing a cd from the US Navy base store.. the Salvadorans asked for permission to hang the sailor in port.  Permission denied.  The ship left port for two days.. then came back.  I am sure they came back without the sailor.  Did that make it to the media and news? i don't think so.. point is: Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?", "authorname": "eatnray", "id": "25030781-3095474622-72157629145969959", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/3095474622/#comment72157629146030549", "realname": "RAUL RAYMON", "path_alias": null, "author": "24474353@N06", "iconserver": "2045", "datecreate": "1328207259", "_content": "Jgury... love the photos of the child growing up and wearing a tailored suit. .. there is no doubt that is the same child. thanks for your efforts.", "authorname": "eatnray", "id": "25030781-3095474622-72157629146030549", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/3095474622/#comment72157629146357317", "realname": "RAUL RAYMON", "path_alias": null, "author": "24474353@N06", "iconserver": "2045", "datecreate": "1328208749", "_content": "My daughter asked me once..&quot;Daddy when will there be world peace?&quot; I said &quot;when man learns not kill things in order to survive.&quot;  \nCannibals exist in this world..the Amazon..

Evil persists as any police blotter or media headline will show you. Wholesale slaughter happens at various times and places around the world. But what we are endeavoring to do is to create peaceful places to live and raise our children.  I was in a group of American men recently and i asked how many had ever been actual witnesses to or involved in a violent fight or crime?  It came out to less than 10%.  Yeah we see it on tv or boxing events, etc.  But its rare in the USA for the most part. That is how life has changed over the last hundred years.  That is what we are striving for.
