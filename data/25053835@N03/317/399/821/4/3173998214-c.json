He was born in Siberia, Russia and emigrated with his mother to the United States in his early childhood where he studied at the National Academy of Design in New York City and the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris under Jean-Paul Laurence. Walkowitz and his contemporaries gravitated around photographer Alfred Stieglitz' 291 Gallery, originally titled the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession, where the forerunners of modern art in America gathered and where many European artists were first exhibited in the United States. During the 291 years, Walkowitz worked closely with Stieglitz as well as Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, and John Marin (often referred to as &quot;The Stieglitz Quartet&quot;).\n\nSource: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Walkowitz\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Walkowitz</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "25030781-3173998214-72157613872878400", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3173998214"}}
