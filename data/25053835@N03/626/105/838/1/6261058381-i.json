Astronomers obtained what is known as the Chandra Deep Field South by pointing the Chandra telescope at the same patch of sky for over six weeks of time. The Chandra sources of this small section of the CDFS are shown in blue. Two &quot;stacked&quot; images, which represent a technique used to find the most distant galaxies in X-ray light, are on the right. The results from this dataset include that black holes are found to be actively growing between 800 million and 950 million years after the Big Bang.\n\n<b>Creator/Photographer:</b> Chandra X-ray Observatory\n\nNASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, which was launched and deployed by Space Shuttle Columbia on July 23, 1999, is the most sophisticated X-ray observatory built to date. The mirrors on Chandra are the largest, most precisely shaped and aligned, and smoothest mirrors ever constructed. Chandra is helping scientists better understand the hot, turbulent regions of space and answer fundamental questions about origin, evolution, and destiny of the Universe. The images Chandra makes are twenty-five times sharper than the best previous X-ray telescope. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., manages the Chandra program for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory controls Chandra science and flight operations from the Chandra X-ray Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n<b>Medium</b>: Chandra telescope x-ray\n\n<b>Date</b>: 2011\n\n<b>Persistent URL</b>: <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2011/cdfs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2011/cdfs/</a>\n\n<b>Repository</b>: <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory</a>\n\n<b>Gift line</b>: X-ray: NASA/CXC/U.Hawaii/E.Treister et al; Infrared: NASA/STScI/UC Santa Cruz/G.Illingworth et al; Optical: NASA/STScI/S.Beckwith et al"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3679", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-10-13 11:35:56", "lastupdate": "1385140108", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1319465614"}, "originalsecret": "ff05f6274e", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6180", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/6261058381/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
