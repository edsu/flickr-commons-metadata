Known officially as Abell 2744, this system has been dubbed Pandora's Cluster because of the wide variety of different structures found.  Data from Chandra (red) show gas with temperatures of millions of degrees.  In blue is a map showing the total mass concentration (mostly dark matter) based on data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the Very Large Telescope (VLT), and the Subaru telescope.  Optical data from HST and VLT also show the constituent galaxies of the clusters.  Astronomers think at least four galaxy clusters coming from a variety of directions are involved with this collision.\n\n<b>Creator/Photographer:</b> Chandra X-ray Observatory\n\nNASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, which was launched and deployed by Space Shuttle Columbia on July 23, 1999, is the most sophisticated X-ray observatory built to date. The mirrors on Chandra are the largest, most precisely shaped and aligned, and smoothest mirrors ever constructed. Chandra is helping scientists better understand the hot, turbulent regions of space and answer fundamental questions about origin, evolution, and destiny of the Universe. The images Chandra makes are twenty-five times sharper than the best previous X-ray telescope. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., manages the Chandra program for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory controls Chandra science and flight operations from the Chandra X-ray Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n<b>Medium</b>: Chandra telescope x-ray\n\n<b>Date</b>: 2011\n\n<b>Gift line</b>: X-ray: NASA/CXC/ITA/INAF/J.Merten et al, Lensing: NASA/STScI; NAOJ/Subaru; ESO/VLT, Optical: NASA/STScI/R.Dupke\n\n<b>Persistent URL</b>: <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2011/a2744/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2011/a2744/</a>\n\n<b>Repository</b>: <a href=\"http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://collections.si.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View more collections from the Smithsonian Institution.</b></a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4306", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-10-13 11:35:54", "lastupdate": "1361905324", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1319465614"}, "originalsecret": "b25a611924", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6174", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/6261584312/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
