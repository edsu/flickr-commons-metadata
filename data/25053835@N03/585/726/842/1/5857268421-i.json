He did not testify on the stand but his statement was entered into the court record.  After earning his Ph.D. at Columbia University in 1914, he worked as ethnologist at Field Museum and was a member of various expeditions to the Malay peninsula, Sumatra, Java, and Borneo.  He then became the first anthropologist in the sociology department at the University of Chicago and served as chairman of the department of anthropology from 1929 to 1947.
