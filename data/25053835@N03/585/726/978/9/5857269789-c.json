Because the Science Service photographs are in the records of a news service that supplied photographs to newspapers and also used them as illustrations in their magazine, Science News-Letter, the original photographs retain crop marks and similar remnants of the publishing process. The Horatio Hackett Newman photograph above shows both crop marks and grease pencil outlining of the head. Science Service then made a small \u201chead-shot\u201d version to supply to its subscribers.  Paper copies of those versions are in the original folder.  Other photographs in the Smithsonian Flickr sets where crop marks or airbrushing techniques are visible are: \n\nNathalia Clara Ruth Crane (SIA2008-0687)[http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/3358890911/]\n\nAlbert Ernest Jenks (SIA2008-4420)\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/4729473393/]\n\nor the group photo of famous physicists (2008-0577) where the photo editor clearly planned to create a head shot of Enrico Fermi.\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/4406390964/]\n\n\nBest, \nSmithsonian Institution Archives", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-5857269789-72157629592542392", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "5857269789"}}
