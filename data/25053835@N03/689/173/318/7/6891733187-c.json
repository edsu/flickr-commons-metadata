She stayed in the United States after the war and became known as one of the best experimental physicists of her time, said Nina Byers, a retired physics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n&quot;In the mid-1950s, two theoretical physicists, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang, approached Wu to help disprove the law of parity. The law holds that in quantum mechanics, two physical systems\u2014like atoms\u2014that were mirror images would behave in identical ways.\n\n&quot;Wu's experiments using cobalt-60, a radioactive form of the cobalt metal, upended this law, which had been accepted for 30 years.\n\n&quot;This milestone in physics led to a 1957 Nobel Prize for Yang and Lee\u2014but not for Wu, who was left out despite her critical role. 'People found [the Nobel decision] outrageous,' said Byers.\n\n&quot;Pnina Abir-Am, a historian of science at Brandeis University, agreed, adding that ethnicity also played a role.\n\n&quot;Wu died of a stroke in 1997 in New York.&quot;\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "25030781-6891733187-72157633518502547", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/6891733187/#comment72157633760520981", "realname": "Smithsonian Institution", "path_alias": "smithsonian", "author": "25053835@N03", "iconserver": "2282", "datecreate": "1369747242", "_content": "Thank you for link to this, Pixel Wrangler.
