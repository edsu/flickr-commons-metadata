And she would have 13 years in 1929, so her mum Lulu would have around 35-45 years old wich correlate with your picture.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.merkur-online.de/bilder/2010/03/16/675237/316283223-3979168_530-1809.jpg\" />\n\n<a href=\"http://www.merkur-online.de/lokales/weilheim/landkreis/ms-kranke-lagen-herzen-675237.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MS-Kranke lagen ohr am Herzen</a>\n\nOn this book, page 357,I asked a friend speaking German, and it is said approximately that Lulu Bomhard assumed the functions of his father work in the last years of life of this one.\nsource: <a href=\"http://books.google.fr/books?id=hUAz-AGLWc0C&amp;pg=PA357&amp;dq=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oskar von Miller 1855-1934: eine Biography by Wilhelm F\u00fcssi</a>\n\nI found maybe a descendant of Oskar von Miller and sent an email; waiting for the answer.\n\nMost of the things are in german wich I do not speak so, maybe I am really wrong, But I feel an intuition !\n\nThanks,\ncoloramisu", "authorname": "coloramisu", "id": "25030781-6891732193-72157638591147454", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/6891732193/#comment72157638632077046", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "77301978@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1386934756", "_content": "You can already correct this : \nBy an answer of a relative of the family, Oscar von Miller created the Deutsches Museum in <b>Munich</b>, not in Berlin.", "authorname": "coloramisu", "id": "25030781-6891732193-72157638632077046", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "6891732193"}}
