He would have been a small boy during the time encompassed by most of the records (that is, up through 1966, when Watson Davis retired).  I suspect that, because the Smithsonian and not Science Service is mentioned in the comment above, Parker Davis may have either worked for the Smithsonian (remember that Malcolm Davis, the brother of Watson and Fremont, was a senior person at Smithsonian Zoo) or did freelance photography for some part of the Smithsonian Institution.  I suggest a check of the personnel records or perhaps the Zoo records.  There's also some Fremont Davis material at George Washington University archives.&quot;\n\nWe'll look into this for you, but I thought you'd like to hear the most recent update!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nCatherine\nSmithsonian Institution Archives", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-4729473077-72157625513681293", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4729473077"}}
