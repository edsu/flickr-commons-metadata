The reason I think this is the stern of the ship is that there are two blocks at the end of the upper boom. (whatever it is). This would indicate to me that they are part of the peak halyard on a gaff sail. At first, after reading this, I thought, maybe this IS a staysail, inboard of the bowsprit, but no, those two blocks and the gaff boom they are attached to, would not be on a staysail, so what the above refers to as the foreshortened bowsprit has to be the main boom.\nSorry guys, I'll not bother you again. but it's like saying &quot;aint&quot; in front of an English teacher. :-)", "authorname": "Searoom SF", "id": "25030781-6351080300-72157628116816509", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/6351080300/#comment72157628249661655", "realname": "Smithsonian Institution", "path_alias": "smithsonian", "author": "25053835@N03", "iconserver": "2282", "datecreate": "1322849936", "_content": "We have updated the title of this image. \n\nThank you!\n\nSusannah\nSmithsonian Institution Archives", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-6351080300-72157628249661655", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "6351080300"}}
