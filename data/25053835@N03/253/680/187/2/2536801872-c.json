Webb was to carry the mail from New York to Boston on a trial run to connect the two cities by air. Webb carried a passenger, mechanic Robert Heck, with him on the flight. \n\n&quot;Lost because of bad weather during the trip, Lieutenant Webb landed in a pasture to get his bearings, then continued on to <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10262/1234\">Franklin Park aviation field</a> in Saugus, Massachusetts. On landing, the airplane hit a mudhole, flipping over. \n\n&quot;Fortunately neither Webb nor his mechanic were injured. The airplane was repaired, and Webb returned to New York five days later with mail and another passenger, Boston's postmaster William Murray. Webb noted that weather wasn't much better on the way back. &quot;Visibility was zero-zero, and I just skimmed over the telephone poles all the way.&quot;\n\nThis airplane has been referred to as <u>both</u> a  <i>Curtiss R-4</i> and a  <i>Jenny JN-4 </i>.   I don't know if that is a contradiction or not.", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "25030781-2536801872-72157614627353691", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2536801872/#comment72157625389606723", "realname": "", "path_alias": "landoni", "author": "14279793@N06", "iconserver": "3801", "datecreate": "1291314513", "_content": "I found this photo in a museum in Denver Colorado:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/landoni/5225788598/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5203/5225788598_38ae9e81e0_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"451\" alt=\"An Aeroplane In World War One\" /></a>\n.", "authorname": "thegreatlandoni", "id": "25030781-2536801872-72157625389606723", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2536801872"}}
