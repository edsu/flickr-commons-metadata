She worked as an assistant at Harvard College Observatory until 1912 when she went to Nantucket on a 4-year Astronomical Fellowship from the Maria Mitchell Association. She was appointed Director of the Observatory in 1916 when she received her M.A. degree from the University of California. She also taught at the Volkman School (Boston), the Buckingham School (Cambridge), and the Faulkner School (Dedham).\n    MH taught evening classes in navigation to adults and, during World War II, to members of the Navy Sea Bees in Nantucket. She also taught at M.I.T. during the war.\n    MH was secretary to her class at Radcliffe from 1905-1922. She was also active in civic projects.\n    MH was the only woman astronomer to have photographed three solar eclipses. She belonged to many astronomical societies, both here and abroad.\n    In 1957, following her retirement from the Maria Mitchell Observatory, M.H. was presented a Graduate Chapter Medal by Radcliffe College for distinguished achievement.\n</blockquote>My daughter, who just started high school, is thinking of astronomy as a career. Next time she has to do a &quot;famous scientists&quot; report, I'll steer her towards this woman. :)", "authorname": "Brenda Anderson", "id": "25030781-5493809069-72157626163358885", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/5493809069/#comment72157626168171247", "realname": "Smithsonian Institution", "path_alias": "smithsonian", "author": "25053835@N03", "iconserver": "2282", "datecreate": "1300451828", "_content": "Thanks for the bio, Brenda!  \n\nSusannah \nSmithsonian Institution Archives\n\np.s.
