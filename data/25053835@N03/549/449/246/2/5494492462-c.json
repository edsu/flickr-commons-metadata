When we import images to Flickr, it automatically pulls over image metadata, which is often very old--clearly what happened above. We've changed it, and we thank you!\n\nBest,\nCatherine Shteynberg\nSmithsonian Institution Archives", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-5494492462-72157626279668718", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "5494492462"}}
