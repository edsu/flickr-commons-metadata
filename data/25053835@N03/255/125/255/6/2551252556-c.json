B. Newman &amp; Co., a printing &amp; bookbinding company located at 617 S Gay St in Knoxville, TN. Given that we appear to be looking at the backside of the business, I think we're just off of Market St SW, in the alley between Church Ave S and Clinch Ave S. That would put us on the backside of the Old Customs House, the first floor of which, according to Wikipedia, was used as a post office until around 1934.\n\n<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=market+&amp;+clinch,+knoxville,+tn&amp;ll=35.963491,-83.918553&amp;spn=0.002514,0.003449&amp;hnear=Clinch+Ave+&amp;+Market+St+SW,+Knoxville,+Knox,+Tennessee+37902&amp;t=m&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=35.963491,-83.918553&amp;panoid=o7Dj4JL35hGHEmRXCSV8BQ&amp;cbp=12,60.84,,0,-2.66\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here's the view today</a> in Google Street View. The road's been redone a bit, and the buildings at the end of the alley are gone, but the windows, arches, keystones, etc, of the Old Customs House to our left definitely look right.\n\nThe Customs House is now home to the East Tennessee Historical Society.
