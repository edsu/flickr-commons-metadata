Letters received from William B. Reed, American minister to China, document the negotiations that led to the Treaty of Tientsin. Letters from Samuel Wells Williams and Edward W. Syle describe the American missionary movement in China and efforts to eradicate the opium trade.&quot;\n\nSo it seems likely that this picture is from that cruise, which was from 1857 to 1859.  Probably taken in China, maybe in Tientsin (aka Tianjin).  The treaty was signed in June 1858.\n\nAnother may be Captain (later Admiral) Franklin Buchanan.

The introduction to the finding aid to Du Pont's papers (see link above) says:\n\n&quot;Du Pont returned to Wilmington where he remained until March 22, 1860. When the Japanese sent their first ambassador to the United States, he was asked to serve as an official escort. Together with two fellow officers, Commander Sidney Smith Lee and Lieutenant David Dixon Porter, he accompanied the ambassador's party on a three-month visit to Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. This trip proved to be a major watershed in Japanese-American relations and helped open up Japan to U.S. trade and investment.&quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "25030781-2551416188-72157611326480540", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2551416188/#comment72157612407030939", "realname": "Carolyn B", "path_alias": "vintagepix", "author": "18774104@N00", "iconserver": "7332", "datecreate": "1231712962", "_content": "Meant to post that when I tried to find the title and date of the exhibit I was thinking of, I kept coming across references to this 1995 SI publication <a href=\"http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace/handle/10088/1343\">Artifacts of Diplomacy</a> about the objects brought back from Japan by Perry (which were displayed in the White House when the Japanese delegation visited in 1860)  At the time that was written the gifts were all part of NMNH's anthropology collections.\n\nBelow are some of the objects Smillie photographed that I think look like Japanese lacquerware and might possibly be associated with Perry's collection or the 1860 visit. \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2551378794\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3107/2551378794_7fb79c1915_m.jpg\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2550556335\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3011/2550556335_3d71423812_m.jpg\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2551377612\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3102/2551377612_f2553e8144_m.jpg\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2550554311\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3271/2550554311_1ae1652ec1_m.jpg\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2551313692\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3119/2551313692_9d38a61491_m.jpg\" /></a>", "authorname": "vintagepix", "id": "25030781-2551416188-72157612407030939", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2551416188"}}
