If they put that bacterium in another person, they too developed Tuberculosis.  Thus, they reasoned, the bacterium caused the illness.\n\nIt's &quot;only a theory&quot; though, so if a doctor says your bronchitis is caused by evil spirits and sinful thoughts, you no doubt believe him.

It says nothing about the existence or not of God.  And evolutionists clearly don't believe they are immortal - as you rather bizarrely seem to suggest.\n\nOnce again.  How can you argue against it, when you have no idea what it is?\n\nYou claimed that evolutionists claim that something came from nothing.

Your whole argument against evolution rests on the &quot;it's just a theory&quot; concept. @ thecaveofthedead tells you that you are using the word theory in it's everday sense, not it's scientific meaning.\n\nEd Pearlstein explains this well, &quot;A theory is built upon one or more hypotheses, and upon evidence. The word &quot;built&quot; is essential, for a theory contains reasoning and logical connections based on the hypotheses and evidence. Thus we have Newton's theory of gravity and the motion of planets, Einstein's theory of relativity, the germ theory of disease, the cell theory of organisms, plate tectonics (theory of the motion of land masses), the valence theory of chemical compounds, and theories of evolution in biology, geology, and astronomy. These theories are self-consistent and consistent with one another.&quot;\n\nThus scientists use the word theory to mean something very close to fact.
