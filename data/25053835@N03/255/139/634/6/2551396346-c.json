The 'faux French' caption reads: &quot;Mais un monsieur qui pense lui meme tres beaucoups plus bon regardons que vraiment il est!&quot; (Rough translation: Just a man who thinks he's better looking than he really is!&quot;).\n\nThe character in question may be a famous figure of the time, but more likely this is Punch identifying social 'stereotypical' characters seen around town, such as this business trader, perhaps seen as vulgar in his efforts to flaunt his wealth by dressing showily unlike the smartly dressed soldiers around him, something of a 'flash harry' type, with a phonetic knowledge of a foreign language passing for education. Or it may be a comment on how the French (the soldiers observing) see the English as uncouth of dress and speech?\n\nThe lower picture now seems embarrassingly ill-informed, but was perhaps typical of the time.", "authorname": "~Notes", "id": "25030781-2551396346-72157606179728563", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2551396346"}}
