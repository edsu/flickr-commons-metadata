W. Peters to Mr. W. de C. Ravenel requesting the forwarding of &quot;my picture 'Battle of Caloocan'&quot; which is presumably the picture to be found at <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Battle_before_Caloocan,_02-10-1899.jpg\">commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Battle_before_Caloocan,_...</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=FmASAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14\">books.google.com/books?id=FmASAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lp...</a>\nshows that it was included in The Exhibits of the Smithsonian Institution and United States National Museum at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, Seattle, Washington, 1909\n\nThe same book says (on page 5), &quot;The act also provided that the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum should exhibit such articles and material of an historical nature as would impart a knowledge of our national history, especially that of Alaska, Hawaii and the Philippine Islands, and that part of the United States west of the Rocky Mountains. The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution designated Mr. Ravenel, Administrative Assistant, U. S. National Museum, as representative of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum to the Government Board, which was created by Congress and charged with the preparation of the exhibit.&quot;\n\nSo perhaps Peters had loaned the picture and wanted it back.  The Battle of Caloocan was in the Philippines near the start of the Spanish-American War.  As noticed on the Wikipedia page, the picture was published in a 1899 book, &quot;Harper's Pictorial History of the War with Spain, Vol. II&quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "25030781-2551333426-72157608690325826", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2551333426"}}
