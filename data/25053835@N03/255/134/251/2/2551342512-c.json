Built in 1774 for patriot Mathias Hammond, the house epitomizes the sophisticated lifestyle of colonial Annapolis. With its ornately carved mouldings, this house is considered the finest example of five-part Georgian architecture in colonial America, featuring formal rooms with mid 18th and early 19th century furnishings and fine arts. The fine collections include portraits by the Peale family. A public museum since 1926, the Hammond-Harwood House Association maintains the house and grounds.&quot;", "authorname": "canaan_1977", "id": "25030781-2551342512-72157616550438008", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2551342512/#comment72157617516085186", "realname": "Smithsonian Institution Archives", "path_alias": "siaflickr", "author": "36501046@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1241101748", "_content": "Thank you swanq for your identification of the Hammond-Harwood House and the Homewood stables cyanotypes by Thomas Smillie!
