The blue tint is because it's a cyanotype. Below is more information about that photo process. You can also see more cyanotypes from the Smithsonian's collections here - <a href=\"http://photography.si.edu/SearchImage.aspx?a_med=67\">http://photography.si.edu/SearchImage.aspx?a_med=67</a> \n\nCyanotype \nSir John Herschel invented the process for printing a cyanotype\u2014more commonly known as a blueprint\u2014in 1842. Creating a cyanotype involved developing prepared paper with an iron-salt solution. After treating the paper with ferric ammonium citrate and potassium ferriyanide, a photographer would place a negative, or even a drawing, on top of it in direct sunlight, causing the exposed parts of the paper to turn bright blue from the effects of the iron. Subsequently submerging the print in water caused the image to become fixed and the unexposed chemicals to wash away, and the iron\u2019s oxidation caused the blue image to intensify. Engineers and architects favored this process for copying drawings because it was stable, efficient, and inexpensive. Thomas Smillie, the Smithsonian\u2019s first photographer, employed this printing method to keep track of his glass-plate negatives. He made and cataloged cyanotypes of each image, after which he stored the corresponding glass-plate negative.", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-2551448398-72157607079224351", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2551448398/#comment72157609555039344", "realname": "Trotarranchos", "path_alias": null, "author": "23642444@N02", "iconserver": "2329", "datecreate": "1227198293", "_content": "este si que es un orgullo, este uno de los mejores usos que se le puede dar a las nuevas tecnolog\u00edas a fin de que un mayor numero de personas acceda a todo este acervo hist\u00f3rico y cultural...\n\nsaludos desde M\u00e9xico!\n\n:)", "authorname": "Pedro Bautista", "id": "25030781-2551448398-72157609555039344", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2551448398/#comment72157623486065570", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "21891888@N00", "iconserver": "5343", "datecreate": "1266848035", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/20595373@N00/\">Face Time</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "minions & myrmidons", "id": "25030781-2551448398-72157623486065570", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2551448398"}}
