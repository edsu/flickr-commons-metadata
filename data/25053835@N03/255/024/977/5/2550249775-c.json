He found that his airmail service supervisors were just as demanding. After landing 55 minutes late because of fog, he was suspended without pay. Only the intervention of ex-pilot Chief of Flying James C. Edgerton kept Biffle on the payroll.\n\n&quot;After he left the Air Mail Service on October 22, 1919, he flew for different organizations, including the Nebraska Aircraft Corporation in Lincoln, Nebraska. While serving as a flying instructor there in April 1922, Biffle taught flying to a lanky young man named Charles Lindbergh. In<i> &quot;We,</i>&quot; written by Lindbergh in 1928, he noted that Biffle's reputation as &quot;the most \u2018hard boiled' instructor the army ever had during [World War I]&quot; was still well known among the aviation students.\n\n&quot;Ira Biffle returned to flying for the Air Mail Service on August 6, 1923 and stayed on as a pilot until the service was turned over to commercial companies. In 1930, he was forced to retire as a pilot due to his failing eyesight. Biffle passed away on April 7, 1934 at the age of 44 of heart disease.&quot;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "25030781-2550249775-72157614632652989", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2550249775"}}
