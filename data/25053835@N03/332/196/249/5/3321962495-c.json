She was the recognized expert on the Lu (Lutheran) blood group.\n\nWhile she did not herself discover the Lutheran blood group, she did discover (in 1961, not 1962) the very rare <i>Lu(a-b-)</i> phenotype in her own blood.  For many years, only one person outside the Crawford family - the patient in Great Britain - was known to carry this phenotype.\n\nA note regarding blood groups: Blood <i>groups</i> are often confused with blood <i>types</i>.  Blood <i>types</i> are genetic expressions within blood <i>groups</i>.  All people carry all blood groups but their phenotypes (&quot;blood types&quot;) within those groups will differ and may even be unique for a given individual.\n\nThe best-known blood groups are <i>ABO</i> and <i>Rh</i>; others include (but are not limited to) <i>Lu</i> (Lutheran), <i>K</i> (Kell), <i>Le</i> (Lewis), <i>Fy</i> (Duffy) and <i>Jk</i> (Kidd).\n\nAn excellent treatise on this subject is <i>Blood Groups in Man</i> by Race &amp; Sanger, in which Dr. Crawford's work is mentioned.", "authorname": "acrawfordiii", "id": "25030781-3321962495-72157624231765142", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/3321962495/#comment72157624238756260", "realname": "Smithsonian Institution", "path_alias": "smithsonian", "author": "25053835@N03", "iconserver": "2282", "datecreate": "1276100250", "_content": "Hi acrawfordiii, \n\nThanks for sharing more information about Dr. Crawford with our community!\n\nSusannah", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-3321962495-72157624238756260", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3321962495"}}
