Her father Martin Meara, an Irish railroad worker, was hung as a murderer when Mary Agnes was a toddler.  After a elementary education in Chicago, Mary Agnes quit school to work as a newspaper typesetter, a proofreader, even as a meat inspector.  She was briefly married, then widowed, at 19.  She had always been artistic, and interested in plants; a minister who was also a botanist hired Mary  \nAgnes to draw specimens of mosses he had collected.  Some of her  \nillustrations were selected for publication in scientific journals.  In  \n1903, she took a Washington-based job as an illustrator for the US  \nDepartment of Agriculture.  She would eventually become a senior botanist  at the Smithsonian, and one of the world's experts on grasses of North America.  She went on several collecting expeditions to Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, and Puerto Rico (her personal collection was donated to the Smithsonian and the National Herbarium).  Her strongly feminist politics led her to activism that endangered her government employment, including jail time and forced feedings during a hunger strike for  suffrage.\n\nHere's a local history account mentioning her father's lynching, for  \nthe murder of his son, the older brother of Mary Agnes Meara:\n<a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.com/~ilicgs/monthly/meara2.htm\">www.rootsweb.com/~ilicgs/monthly/meara2.htm</a>", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "25030781-3321968965-72157615341217480", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/3321968965/#comment72157615936867868", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "34441597@N00", "iconserver": "103", "datecreate": "1238085795", "_content": "An inspiring story, of success against the odds.", "authorname": "sezohanim", "id": "25030781-3321968965-72157615936867868", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/3321968965/#comment72157617019344533", "realname": "John", "path_alias": null, "author": "32998163@N00", "iconserver": "36", "datecreate": "1240279644", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/920954@N21/\">Systematic Botany (not for &quot;pretty flower images&quot;)</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Just Back", "id": "25030781-3321968965-72157617019344533", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/3321968965/#comment72157617037200065", "realname": "Arnaldo Principe do Amaral", "path_alias": null, "author": "23807594@N05", "iconserver": "2644", "datecreate": "1240319801", "_content": "I'm brasilian Veterinary of bovine .
