Hall McCormick purchased the property in the early 1900s as a small farm as an escape from the main house, Mizzentop, and as a place to keep his horses for four-in-hand coaching.  The house was initially used as a playhouse and his daughters stored their gowns upstairs to serve the busy Bar Harbor ball season.  Mr. McCormick was a vice president for the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company and also owned much real estate in Chicago and Lake Forest, building the Roanoke Tower and the McCormick Building.", "authorname": "wendyb2004", "id": "25030781-3953278394-72157631763219359", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3953278394"}}
