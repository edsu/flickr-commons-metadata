It was these vertebrae that led to the discovery of the huge bone bed that became the Dinosaur National Monument quarry, which is on the Utah side. The photo was taken on August 17 or 18, 1909. The image is backwards because the tail vertebrae extended down and towards the west (left).", "authorname": "ktneprac", "id": "25030781-5987576291-72157631800627337", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/5987576291/#comment72157631836526997", "realname": "Smithsonian Institution", "path_alias": "smithsonian", "author": "25053835@N03", "iconserver": "2282", "datecreate": "1351007016", "_content": "Thank you for the additional information, Ktneprac!  I changed the date to reflect what is on the finding aid.  Would you mind pointing us to some of the sources that enabled you to identify Goodrich and the exact date of the photograph?  As for the orientation of the photograph, due to their format and age, it is sometimes very difficult to tell which side the emulsion is on or if these are originals or copies (which can affect orientation regardless of emulsion side and therefore help in deciding which way to scan). Your keen eye gives some great things to think about for us and others looking at these images.  Thanks again, Ktneprac!", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-5987576291-72157631836526997", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "5987576291"}}
