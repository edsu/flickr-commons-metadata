This slide is not labeled information except for the number 29055.  I changed the date to reflect the date provided on the finding aid.  The locality information was also taken from the finding aid.  I will forward your comment to the Department of Paleobiology.  If any of the staff agree with your assessment, we will change the caption for this image.  Also, would you be able to point us to another image of Levi Sternberg so we may compare the two images?
