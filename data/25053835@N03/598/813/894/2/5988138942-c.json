After receiving your comments, we went back to these slides to check the information on them.  I changed the date above to &quot;undated&quot;.  The only information on the slide is &quot;Diplodocus over 80ft in length.&quot;  No date or locality is provided for this slide.  The locality information was taken from the finding aid.  I also changed the locality to &quot;possibly&quot; Dinosaur National Monument Quarry.  We weren't able to find any further documentation for this image.  Would you mind sharing some of your sources with us?  In particular, we are interested in knowing how you were able to identify O. A. Peterson, the locality, and the specimen number.  Any additional information is appreciated.  In the meanwhile, I will ask staff from the Department of Paleobiology if they have any additional information.  Thank you again.\n\nsonoe\nField Book Project", "authorname": "Smithsonian Institution", "id": "25030781-5988138942-72157631836489004", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "5988138942"}}
