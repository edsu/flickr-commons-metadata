I wasn't able to access the full text of Reptilian fauna of the North Horn Formation of central Utah on Google Books.  Is there another photo online of the Alamosaurus site on North Horn Mountain in Utah that we can compare this image to?  This slide was not labeled.  The information about Dinosaur National Monument came from the finding aid from this collection which can be found here <a href=\"http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_216991\" rel=\"nofollow\">siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_216991</a> (scroll down to box 7).  I will forward these links to the Department of Paleobiology to see if someone in that department knows more about the origin of these slides.
