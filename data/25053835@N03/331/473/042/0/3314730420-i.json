He embraced the new technology, sitting frequently, and he was interested in both technological issues and composition. Perhaps because of his early struggle to make himself into somebody of substance\u2014to make himself visible\u2014Lincoln was acutely aware of the power of image-making. Although Lincoln knew, and joked about, the fact that he was a difficult subject, he was not camera-shy, producing a continuous portrait record of his time in office. Attuned to public opinion, Lincoln used portraits to keep himself in the eye of his fellow citizens. When he arrived in Washington, Lincoln quickly arranged to have himself photographed at Alexander Gardner\u2019s studio. These photographs were the first widely disseminated pictures of the president with his newly grown beard.\n\nPublisher: Edward &amp; Henry T.
