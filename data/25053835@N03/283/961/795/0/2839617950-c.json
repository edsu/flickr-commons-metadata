Unless by &quot;yurok canoe&quot; you meant owned by a Yurok.  Then I really can't argue since I don't know who owned it.  But I know 100% this is NOT a traditional Yurok canoe.  And on a side note, Yurok's typically wouldn't be paddling up the Trinity River.  That was Hoopa territory.  This photo has got to be labeled incorrectly.  I would hope by accident.  Either way, I see this picture all the time on the net.  And it is INCORRECT.  At the very least look into what a Yurok canoe looks like.  And maybe brush up on the Yurok territory.  Just a suggestion.  ;)", "authorname": "NorthernNDN", "id": "25030781-2839617950-72157622419709869", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/2839617950/#comment72157622550306948", "realname": "Smithsonian Institution Libraries", "path_alias": "smithsonianlibraries", "author": "7576993@N07", "iconserver": "3103", "datecreate": "1255114886", "_content": "NorthernNDN, thank you for that comment and pointing out the discrepencies. \n\nThe title of the photo was taken directly from the Curtis image (which you can see in the bottom left of the photograph).
