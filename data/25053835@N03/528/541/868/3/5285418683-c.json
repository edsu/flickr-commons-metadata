The reason I say this photo is around 1940 is based on the last auto you see on the left of the photo.  That is at least 1940, maybe a bit later.  I can also tell just by the clothing this is not 1933 or before.  And now that I think about it, I wonder if this was a patriotic parade right after the Pearl Harbor attack....that would make sense with the snow and the flags on the trucks.\n\nYeah, they are all hung up with Ayn Rand, but 99% of them don't even know she was an atheist and that, I would think, would cause them to call her a commie.
