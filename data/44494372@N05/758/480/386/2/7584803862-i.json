The dice and &quot;Little Joe&quot; are prominently displayed under the cockpit area. (Little Joe is a dice player's slang term for two deuces.) \n\nFive years later when Walker reached 354,200 feet in the X-15, that aircraft carried similar artwork - &quot;Little Joe the II.&quot; Walker is shown in the photo above wearing an early partial pressure suit. This protected the pilot if cockpit pressure was lost above 50,000 feet.\n\nThe X-1 Program was originally designated the XS-1 for EXperimental Sonic. The X-1's mission was to investigate the transonic speed range (speeds from just below to just above the speed of sound) and, if possible, to break the &quot;sound barrier.&quot; Three different X-1s were built and designated: X-1-1, X-1-2 (later modified to become the X-1E), and X-1-3. The basic X-1 aircraft were flown by a large number of different pilots from 1946 to 1951. \n\nThe X-1 Program not only proved that humans could go beyond the speed of sound, it reinforced the understanding that technological barriers could be overcome. The X-1s pioneered many structural and aerodynamic advances including extremely thin, yet extremely strong wing sections; supersonic fuselage configurations; control system requirements; powerplant compatibility; and cockpit environments. The X-1 aircraft were the first transonic-capable aircraft to use an all-moving stabilizer. The flights of the X-1s opened up a new era in aviation. \n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1968", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1958-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1384150181", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1342465465"}, "originalsecret": "c3b880276b", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7273", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/7584803862/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387642755}
