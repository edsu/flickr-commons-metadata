He finally managed to turn back while over the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, and had just enough energy to land on the south end of Rogers Dry Lake at Edwards. In the debriefing, someone asked how much clearance the X-15 had from the Joshua trees on the edge of the lakebed. \u201cOh, at least 100 feet...on either side,\u201d said the chase pilot.\n\nDryden pilot Neil Armstrong is seen here next to the X-15 ship #1 (56-6670) after a research flight. The X-15 was a rocket-powered aircraft 50 feet long with a wingspan of 22 feet. It was a missile-shaped vehicle with an unusual wedge-shaped vertical tail, thin stubby wings, and unique side fairings that extended along the side of the fuselage. The X-15 was flown over a period of nearly 10 years, from June 1959 to October 1968. It set the world's unofficial speed and altitude records. Information gained from the highly successful X-15 program contributed to the development of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo manned spaceflight programs, and also the Space Shuttle program.\n\nImage Credit: NASA\nE60-6286\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~5~5~22260~126874\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~5~5~22260~...</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "11879", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2012-08-27 15:24:45", "lastupdate": "1376000081", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1346107401"}, "originalsecret": "2a6f874b6b", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8428", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/7876041688/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387642479}
