The photo includes the X-3 (in front--Air Force serial number 49-2892) then clockwise D-558-1, XF4D-1 (a Navy jet fighter prototype not flown by the NACA), and the first D-558-2 (NACA tail number 143, Navy serial number 37973), which was flown only once by the NACA. The Dryden Flight Research Center, NASA's premier installation for aeronautical flight research, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1996. Dryden is the &quot;Center of Excellence&quot; for atmospheric flight operations. The Center's charter is to research, develop, verify, and transfer advanced aeronautics, space, and related technologies. It is located at Edwards, Calif., on the western edge of the Mojave Desert, 80 miles north of Los Angeles. Dryden's history dates back to the early fall of 1946, when a group of five aeronautical engineers arrived at what is now Edwards from the NACA's Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, Hampton, Va. Their goal was to prepare for the X-l supersonic research flights in a joint NACA-U.S. Army Air Forces-Bell Aircraft Corp. program. NACA--the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics--was the predecessor of today's NASA. Since the days of the X-l, the first aircraft to fly faster than the speed of sound, the installation has grown in size and significance and is associated with many important developments in aviation -- supersonic and hypersonic flight, wingless lifting bodies, digital fly-by-wire, supercritical and forward-swept wings, and the space shuttles. Its name has changed many times over the years. From 14 November 1949 to 1 July 1954 it bore the name NACA High-Speed Flight Research Station. From 1 July 1954 until 1 October 1958 it was called the NACA High-Speed Flight Station, with Research removed from its name but not its mission.\n\n<a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~2~2~1822~103235\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~2~2~1822~103235</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3575", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1954-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1384153936", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1342734006"}, "originalsecret": "20076fafb5", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8160", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/7605908194/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387642672}
