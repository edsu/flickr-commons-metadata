The Return to Flight mission to the International Space Station carries the External Stowage Platform-2, equipped with spare part assemblies, and a replacement Control Moment Gyroscope contained in the Lightweight Multi-Purpose Experiment Support Structure and Multi-Purpose Logistics Module Raffaello, housing 15 tons of hardware and supplies that will be transferred to the Station after the Shuttle docks to the complex . On this mission, the crew will perform inspections on-orbit for the first time of all of the Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) panels on the leading edge of the wings and the Thermal Protection System tiles using the new Canadian-built Orbiter Boom Sensor System and the data from 176 impact and temperature sensors. Mission Specialists will also practice repair techniques on RCC and tile samples during a spacewalk in the payload bay.\n\n<b>Release Date:</b> 07/26/2005\n\n<b>Photo Number:</b> KSC-05PP-1793\n<b>UID:</b> SPD-KSCMA-KSC-05PP-1 793\n<b>original url:</b> <a href=\"http://mediaarchive.ksc.nasa.gov/detail.cfm?mediaid=26690\" rel=\"nofollow\">mediaarchive.ksc.nasa.gov/detail.cfm?mediaid=26690</a>\n\n<b>SOURCE</b>:  <a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~6~6~47498~151341\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~6~6~47498~151341</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "5163", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-10-31 22:40:43", "lastupdate": "1379448958", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1288590043"}, "originalsecret": "b904efedb4", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4067", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/5134454135/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643204}
