Kelly is ready to take his turn at driving a small armored personnel carrier that is part of emergency egress training during Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test (TCDT) activities. Behind him (left) is Mission Specialist Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Clervoy of France, who is with the European Space Agency. At right is Mission Specialist Steven L. Smith. The tracked vehicle could be used by the crew in the event of an emergency at the pad during which the crew must make a quick exit from the area. The TCDT also provides simulated countdown exercises and opportunities to inspect the mission payloads in the orbiter's payload bay. STS-103 is a &quot;call-up&quot; mission due to the need to replace and repair portions of the Hubble Space Telescope. Four EVA's are planned to make the necessary repairs and replacements on the telescope. The other STS-103 crew members are Commander Curtis L. Brown Jr. and Mission Specialists C. Michael Foale (Ph.D.), John M. Grunsfeld (Ph.D.), plus Claude Nicollier of Switzerland, who also is with the European Space Agency. The mission is targeted for launch Dec. 6 at 2:37 a.m. EST\n\n<b>Release Date:</b> 11/15/1999\n\n<b>Photo Number:</b> KSC-99PP-1314\n<b>UID:</b> SPD-KSCMA-KSC-99PP-1 314\n<b>original url:</b> <a href=\"http://mediaarchive.ksc.nasa.gov/detail.cfm?mediaid=3249\" rel=\"nofollow\">mediaarchive.ksc.nasa.gov/detail.cfm?mediaid=3249</a>\n\n<b>SOURCE</b>:  <a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~6~6~57164~161006\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~6~6~57164~161006</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4981", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-10-31 22:40:48", "lastupdate": "1379448967", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1288590048"}, "originalsecret": "6348f9c62a", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4124", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/5135053344/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643200}
