The initial version of this simulator was located inside the hangar. Later a larger version would be located at the Lunar Landing Facility. This position meant that a person's legs experienced only one sixth of their weight, which was the equivalent of being on the lunar surface. The purpose of this simulator was to study the subject while walking, jumping or running. Researchers conducted studies of various factors such as fatigue limit, energy expenditure, and speed of locomotion.\n\n<b>Date:</b> 12/11/1963\n<b>NASA Center:</b> Langley Research Center\n\n<b>Image #:</b> L-1963-09964\n<b>Original url:</b> <a href=\"http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2000-001782.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2000-001782.html</a>\n<b>UID:</b> SPD-GRIN-GPN-2000-00 1782\n<b>Center:</b> LARC\n<b>Center Number:</b> L-1963-09964\n<b>GRIN DataBase Number:</b> GPN-2000-001782\n\n<b>SOURCE</b>:  <a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~5~5~22873~127185\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~5~5~22873~127185</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "7493", "farm": 2, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-10-31 22:41:19", "lastupdate": "1376000485", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1288590079"}, "originalsecret": "8ef5339bc9", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "1253", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/5135054500/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643164}
