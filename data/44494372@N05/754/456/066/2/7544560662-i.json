Taken with the spacecraft's imaging system using an ultraviolet filter, the picture has been color enhanced to simulate Venus's natural color as the human eye would see it. Although the planet closest to the Earth in size and distance from the Sun, Venus is perpetually blanketed by a thick veil of clouds high in carbon dioxide; its surface temperature approaches 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Launched on November 3, 1973 atop an Atlas Centaur rocket, Mariner 10 flew by Venus on February 5, 1974. It then went on to an encounter with Mercury, thus becoming the first spacecraft ever to fly by more than one planet. Mariner 10 was designed, built and managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Office of Space Science and Applications.\n\n<a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/NVA2~14~14~35757~124213\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/NVA2~14~14~35757~124213</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4761", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1974-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1379448403", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1341944830"}, "originalsecret": "2ca81106b4", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8025", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/7544560662/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387642887}
