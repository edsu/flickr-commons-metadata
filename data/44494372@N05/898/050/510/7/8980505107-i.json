It was launched on October 19th, 1989 by the Space Shuttle Atlantis on the STS-34 mission.\n\nGalileo plunged into Jupiter's crushing atmosphere on Sept. 21, 2003. The spacecraft was deliberately destroyed to protect one of its own discoveries - a possible ocean beneath the icy crust of the moon Europa.\n\nGalileo changed the way we look at our solar system. The spacecraft was the first to fly past an asteroid and the first to discover a moon of an asteroid. It provided the only direct observations of a comet colliding with a planet."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "11567", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2013-06-07 14:23:51", "lastupdate": "1385261500", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1370642282"}, "originalsecret": "cec622cd5c", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3818", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/8980505107/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387642374}
