Because X-rays are absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, Chandra must orbit above it, up to an altitude of 139,000 km (86,500 mi) in space."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "9615", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2013-06-07 14:23:57", "lastupdate": "1383674863", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1370642269"}, "originalsecret": "63c69945f8", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5336", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/8980505863/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387642398}
