The image comes from the last sequence of images Dawn obtained of the giant asteroid Vesta as it departed the giant asteroid.\n\nThe view looks down at Vesta's north pole, which is in the middle of the image. When Dawn arrived in July 2011, Vesta's north pole was in darkness. After more than a year at Vesta, the sunlight has now made it to Vesta's north pole.\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "11783", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2013-06-07 14:23:52", "lastupdate": "1378091524", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1370642280"}, "originalsecret": "25512b725f", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7329", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/8981696138/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387642376}
