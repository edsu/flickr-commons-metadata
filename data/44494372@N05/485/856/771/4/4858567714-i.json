The effort, called the Dryden Aerospike Rocket Test, provided the first known data from a solid-fueled aerospike rocket in flight. Two 10-ft. long solid-fueled rockets with aerospike nozzles were flown successfully on two consecutive flights March 30 and 31, 2004. The flights took place at the King Ranch launch site at the Pecos County Aerospace Development Corporation Flight Test Range in Fort Stockton, Texas.\n\n<b>Photo Date:</b> March 30, 2004\n<b>NASA Photo by:</b> Steve Thomas\n\n<b>Photo Number:</b> EC04-0113-171\n<b>UID:</b> SPD-DRYDEN-EC04-0113 -171\n<b>Original url:</b> <a href=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Gallery/Photo/Aerospike_Rocket/HTML/EC04-0113-171.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Gallery/Photo/Aerospike_Rocket/HTML/EC0...</a>\n\n<b>SOURCE</b>:  <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~8~8~62798~166658\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~8~8~62798~...</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "17159", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-08-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1376000575", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1283151603"}, "originalsecret": "49f0c1cc45", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4100", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/4858567714/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643351}
