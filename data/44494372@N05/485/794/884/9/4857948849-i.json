The cross-country journey will take approximately two days, with stops at several intermediate points for refueling.\n\n<b>Project Description:</b> Space Shuttle Atlantis descended to a smooth landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., concluding a successful assembly mission to the International Space Station. With Commander Rick Sturckow and Pilot Lee Archambault at the controls, Atlantis landed at 12:49 p.m. PDT on June 22, 2007. Atlantis launched June 8, 2007, and arrived at the International Space Station on June 10. While at the orbital outpost, the crew installed the Starboard 3 and 4 truss segment and conducted four spacewalks to activate it. During the third spacewalk, the crew repaired an out of position thermal blanket on the left orbital maneuvering system pod. Atlantis also delivered a new station crew member, Flight Engineer Clayton Anderson. He replaced astronaut Suni Williams, who is the new record holder for a long-duration single spaceflight for a woman. She arrived at the station in December of 2006 with STS-116. STS-117 is the 118th shuttle mission and 21st mission to visit the space station.\n\n<b>Photo Date:</b> July 1, 2007\n<b>NASA Photo by:</b> Carla Thomas\n\n<b>Photo Number:</b> ED07-0137-32\n<b>UID:</b> SPD-DRYDEN-ED07-0137 -32\n<b>Original url:</b> <a href=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Gallery/Photo/STS-117/HTML/ED07-0137-32.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Gallery/Photo/STS-117/HTML/ED07-0137-32...</a>\n\n<b>SOURCE</b>:  <a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~8~8~62547~166395\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~8~8~62547~166395</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "24496", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-08-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1376000578", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1283151602"}, "originalsecret": "49a253ac7a", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4078", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/4857948849/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643458}
