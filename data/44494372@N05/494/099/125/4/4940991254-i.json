Apollo 11 launched from KSC via the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) developed Saturn V launch vehicle on July 16, 1969 and safely returned to Earth on July 24, 1969. Aboard the space craft were astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, commander; Michael Collins, Command Module (CM) pilot; and Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr., Lunar Module (LM) pilot. The CM, &quot;Columbia&quot;, piloted by Collins, remained in a parking orbit around the Moon while the LM, &quot;Eagle&quot;, carrying astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin, landed on the Moon. On July 20, 1969, Armstrong was the first human to ever stand on the lunar surface, followed by Aldrin. During 2\u00bd hours of surface exploration, the crew collected 47 pounds of lunar surface material for analysis back on Earth. With the success of Apollo 11, the national objective to land men on the Moon and return them safely to Earth had been accomplished.\n\n<b>Date of Image:</b> 1969-07-16\n\n<b>Reference Number:</b> MSFC-75-SA-4105-2C\n<b>MIX #:</b> 6900591\n<b>NIX #:</b> MSFC-6900591\n<b>MSFC Negative Number:</b> 6900591\n<b>UID:</b> SPD-MARSH-6900591\n<b>Original url:</b> <a href=\"http://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=4062\" rel=\"nofollow\">mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=4062</a>\n\n<b>SOURCE</b>:  <a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~9~9~59324~163170\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~9~9~59324~163170</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "17328", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-08-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1376000580", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1283151602"}, "originalsecret": "669cde8fea", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4121", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/4940991254/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643398}
