Also building number 3-1726 (seen in the image) matches the current building number format of 1726 which is Hangar S.  \n\nThe KSC and JSC archives have been notified of the update.  \nWe removed the location reference in the &quot;Full Description&quot; above, so as to avoid further confusion on location.
