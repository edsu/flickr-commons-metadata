Built by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. of San Diego, NASA took possession of the aircraft during the fall of 2006. The aircraft has been given the Choctaw Nation name &quot;Ikhana&quot; (pronounced ee-kah-nah), which means intelligent. Designed for long-endurance, high-altitude flight, Ikhana will be flown primarily on Earth science missions under the Earth Science Capability Demonstrations project at NASA Dryden. It will also be used for advanced aircraft systems research and technology development. As part of the Ikhana/Predator B acquisition, NASA also purchased a ground control station and satellite communication system for control of the aircraft and transmittal of research data. The ground control station is in a mobile trailer and, in addition to the pilot's &quot;cockpit,&quot; includes computer workstations for scientists and engineers. All of the aircraft systems are mobile, making Ikhana ideal for remote studies.\n\n<b>Photo Date:</b> March 5, 2007\n<b>NASA Photo by:</b> Tony Landis\n\n<b>Photo Number:</b> ED07-0038-085\n<b>UID:</b> SPD-DRYDEN-ED07-0038 -085\n<b>Original url:</b> <a href=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Gallery/Photo/Ikhana/HTML/ED07-0038-085.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Gallery/Photo/Ikhana/HTML/ED07-0038-085...</a>\n\n<b>SOURCE</b>:  <a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~8~8~62506~166354\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~8~8~62506~166354</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "18729", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-08-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1376000577", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1283151602"}, "originalsecret": "d5b0f5678b", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4096", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/4940404017/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643408}
