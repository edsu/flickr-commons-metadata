The top three images, taken though orange, violet, and ultraviolet filters by the narrow-angle camera, show several bright cloud features, clearly visible in each image. The &quot;scooter&quot; cloud, at 42 degrees south latitude, although prominent in the orange image, is invisible in ultraviolet, where scattering by atmospheric molecules is strongest. The disappearance can be understood if the &quot;scooter cloud has more obscurring atmosphere above it ( i.e. the scooter cloud is lower ) than other bright clouds. The observation also suggest that the centrally located Great Dark Spot is also a low lying feature because it also loses visiblity in the ultraviolet image. The lower three wide angle images ( from left to right: orange, weak methane [541nm], and strong methane [619nm] are arranged in increasing absorption by methane in Neptune's atmosphere. In the lower images the &quot;scooter cloud&quot; becomes less obvious from left to right, implying there is relatively more absorbing methane above the &quot;scooter cloud&quot;. Thus the set of images also implies that the &quot;scooter cloud&quot; is deeper in the atmosphere ( and therefore at higher atmospheric pressure ) than the other bright clouds.\n\n<b>Date:</b> 8/21/89\n<b>Source:</b> <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/AILS_AC89-7003\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.archive.org/details/AILS_AC89-7003</a>\n<b>Identifier:</b> AILS_AC89-7003\n\n<b>SOURCE:</b> <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/NVA2~31~31~67296~128900\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/NVA2~31~31~67296~1...</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4366", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-12-20 10:21:56", "lastupdate": "1379448846", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1292869316"}, "originalsecret": "206449f466", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5006", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/5277460787/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643110}
