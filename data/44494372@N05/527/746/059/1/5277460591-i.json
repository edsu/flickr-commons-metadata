Photodeposition from solutions is a novel process superior to those grown by conventional techniques. Evidence of this is seen when the films are viewed under a microscope; they exhibit small particles of solid polymer which form in the bulk solution, get transported by convection to the surface of the growing film, and become embedded. Also convection tends to cause the film thickness to be less uniform, and may even affect the molecular orientation of the films. The thrust of the research is to investigate in detail, both in 1-g and low-g, the effects of convection (and lack thereof) on this novel and interesting reaction. In this example, a portion of the substrate was blocked from exposure to the UV light by the mask, which was placed on the opposite side of the glass disk as the film, clearly demonstrating that photodeposition occurs only where the substrate is irradiated directly.\n\n<b>Date of Image:</b> 1996-08-01\n<b>Reference Number:</b> MSFC-75-SA-4105-2C\n<b>MIX #:</b> 9804673\n<b>NIX #:</b> MSFC-9804673\n<b>MSFC Negative Number:</b> 9804673\n<b>UID:</b> SPD-MARSH-9804673\n<b>original url:</b> <a href=\"http://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=140\" rel=\"nofollow\">mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=140</a>\n\n<b>SOURCE:</b> <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~9~9~61679~165526\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~9~9~61679~...</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4958", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-12-20 10:21:51", "lastupdate": "1379448869", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1292869311"}, "originalsecret": "2bcd29ed7a", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5241", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/5277460591/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643118}
