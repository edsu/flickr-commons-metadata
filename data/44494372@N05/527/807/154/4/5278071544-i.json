Test subject sitting at the controls: Project LOLA or Lunar Orbit and Landing Approach was a simulator built at Langley to study problems related to landing on the lunar surface. It was a complex project that cost nearly $2 million dollars. James Hansen wrote: &quot;This simulator was designed to provide a pilot with a detailed visual encounter with the lunar surface; the machine consisted primarily of a cockpit, a closed-circuit TV system, and four large murals or scale models representing portions of the lunar surface as seen from various altitudes. The pilot in the cockpit moved along a track past these murals which would accustom him to the visual cues for controlling a spacecraft in the vicinity of the moon. Unfortunately, such a simulation--although great fun and quite aesthetic--was not helpful because flight in lunar orbit posed no special problems other than the rendezvous with the LEM, which the device did not simulate. Not long after the end of Apollo, the expensive machine was dismantled.&quot; (p. 379) Ellis J. White wrote in his paper, &quot;Discussion of Three Typical Langley Research Center Simulation Programs&quot; : &quot;A typical mission would start with the first cart positioned on model 1 for the translunar approach and orbit establishment. After starting the descent, the second cart is readied on model 2 and, at the proper time, when superposition occurs, the pilot's scene is switched from model 1 to model 2. then cart 1 is moved to and readied on model 3. The procedure continues until an altitude of 150 feet is obtained. The cabin of the LM vehicle has four windows which represent a 45 degree field of view. The projection screens in front of each window represent 65 degrees which allows limited head motion before the edges of the display can be seen. The lunar scene is presented to the pilot by rear projection on the screens with four Schmidt television projectors. The attitude orientation of the vehicle is represented by changing the lunar scene through the portholes determined by the scan pattern of four orthicons. The stars are front projected onto the upper three screens with a four-axis starfield generation (starball) mounted over the cabin and there is a separate starball for the low window.\n\n<b>Date:</b> 12.05.1961\n<b>Credit:</b> NASA Langley Research Center (NASA-LaRC)\n<b>ID:</b> EL-2002-00357\n<b>Other ID:</b> L61-8035\n<b>UID:</b> SPD-NIX-EL-2002-0035 7\n<b>Original url:</b> <a href=\"http://nix.ksc.nasa.gov/info?id=EL-2002-00357&amp;orgid=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">nix.ksc.nasa.gov/info?id=EL-2002-00357&amp;orgid=1</a>\n\n<b>SOURCE:</b> <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~2~2~7372~109018\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~2~2~7372~1...</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "6321", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-12-20 10:22:00", "lastupdate": "1379448834", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1292869320"}, "originalsecret": "c5c429423b", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5044", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/5278071544/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643101}
