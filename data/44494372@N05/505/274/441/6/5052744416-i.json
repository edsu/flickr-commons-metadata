Apollo 15 launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on July 26, 1971 via a Saturn V launch vehicle. Aboard was a crew of three astronauts including David R. Scott, Mission Commander; James B. Irwin, Lunar Module Pilot; and Alfred M. Worden, Command Module Pilot. The first mission designed to explore the Moon over longer periods, greater ranges and with more instruments for the collection of scientific data than on previous missions, the mission included the introduction of a $40,000,000 lunar roving vehicle (LRV) that reached a top speed of 16 kph (10 mph) across the Moon's surface. The successful Apollo 15 lunar landing mission was the first in a series of three advanced missions planned for the Apollo program. The primary scientific objectives were to observe the lunar surface, survey and sample material and surface features in a preselected area of the Hadley-Apennine region, setup and activation of surface experiments and conduct in-flight experiments and photographic tasks from lunar orbit. Apollo 15 televised the first lunar liftoff and recorded a walk in deep space by Alfred Worden. Both the Saturn V rocket and the LRV were developed at the Marshall Space Flight Center.\n\n<b>Date of Image:</b> 1971-07-26\n<b>Reference Number:</b> MSFC-75-SA-4105-2C\n<b>MIX #:</b> 7022580\n<b>NIX #:</b> MSFC-7022580\n<b>MSFC Negative Number:</b> 7022580\n<b>UID:</b> SPD-MARSH-7022580\n<b>Original url:</b> <a href=\"http://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=3032\" rel=\"nofollow\">mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=3032</a>\n\n<b>SOURCE</b>:  <a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~9~9~60133~163980\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~9~9~60133~163980</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "9002", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-10-04 16:11:38", "lastupdate": "1376000502", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1286233898"}, "originalsecret": "ec3ce0a8a1", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4111", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/5052744416/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643264}
