The spacecraft acquired a total of 60 frames for a mosaic of the solar system from a distance of more than 4 billion miles from Earth and about 32 degrees above the ecliptic. From Voyager's great distance Earth is a mere point of light, less than the size of a picture element even in the narrow-angle camera. Earth was a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size. Coincidentally, Earth lies right in the center of one of the scattered light rays resulting from taking the image so close to the sun. This blown-up image of the Earth was taken through three color filters -- violet, blue and green -- and recombined to produce the color image. The background features in the image are artifacts resulting from the magnification.\n\n<b>Addition Date:</b> 1996-09-12\n<b>Produced By:</b> JPL\n<b>Image #:</b> PIA00452\n<b>UID:</b> SPD-PHOTJ-PIA00452\n<b>Original url:</b> <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00452\" rel=\"nofollow\">photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00452</a>\n<b>SOURCE</b>:  <a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~4~4~8152~109810\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~4~4~8152~109810</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "8238", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-10-04 16:13:40", "lastupdate": "1376000501", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1286234020"}, "originalsecret": "26bc7c2542", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4147", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/5052129467/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643231}
