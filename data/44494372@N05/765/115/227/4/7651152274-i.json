Mariner 7 photographed the same area in August, 1969 (bottom) at which time the entire region was covered with dry ice. The strange quasilinear features of 1969 have been replaced by a number of bright curved appendages never before seen on Mars and, at this time, unexplained. \n\nMariner 9 was the first spacecraft to orbit another planet. The spacecraft was designed to continue the atmospheric studies begun by Mariners 6 and 7, and to map over 70% of the Martian surface from the lowest altitude (1500 kilometers [900 miles])and at the highest resolutions (1 kilometer per pixel to 100 meters per pixel) of any previous Mars mission. \n\nMariner 9 was launched on May 30, 1971 and arrived on November 14, 1971.\n\n<a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~4~4~10765~112757:South-Polar-Cap-of-Mars-as-seen-by-\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~4~4~10765~1127...</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "6909", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1969-08-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1379443682", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1343322788"}, "originalsecret": "3c18b5a4eb", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8291", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/7651152274/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387642555}
