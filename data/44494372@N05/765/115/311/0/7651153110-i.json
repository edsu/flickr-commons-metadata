This higher resolution photograph shows that the area contains a complex crater, called Olympus Mons (Nix Olympica or Snows of Olympus), nearly 64 kilometers (40 miles) in diameter. The multiple crater form with scalloped margins, is characteristic of calderas--volcanic collapse depressions on Earth. In the Mariner 6 and 7 flights in 1969, an outer ring, 1600 kilometers (1,000 miles) in diameter, was seen. It is hidden by the dust in the oblique picture. Earth-based radar observations show that this is a high region on Mars and is usually covered by a white cloud when observed telescopically. This picture was taken on November 27, 1971. \n\nMariner 9 was the first spacecraft to orbit another planet. The spacecraft was designed to continue the atmospheric studies begun by Mariners 6 and 7, and to map over 70% of the Martian surface from the lowest altitude (1500 kilometers [900 miles])and at the highest resolutions (1 kilometer per pixel to 100 meters per pixel) of any previous Mars mission. \n\nMariner 9 was launched on May 30, 1971 and arrived on November 14, 1971.\n\n<a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~4~4~10748~112740:Mariner-9-views-Olympus-Mons-standi\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~4~4~10748~1127...</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "7672", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1971-11-27 10:13:17", "lastupdate": "1379443662", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1343322797"}, "originalsecret": "3b81aa5193", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8163", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/7651153110/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387642550}
