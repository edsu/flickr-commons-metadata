Too anxious to wait for the official processed image, employees from the Voyager Telecommunications Section attached these strips side by side to a display panel and hand colored the numbers like a paint-by-numbers picture. The completed image was framed and presented to JPL director, William Pickering. Mariner 4 was launched on November 28, 1964 and journeyed for 228 days to the Red Planet, providing the first close-range images of Mars. The spacecraft carried a television camera and six other science instruments to study the Martian atmosphere and surface. The 22 photographs taken by Mariner revealed the existence of lunar type craters upon a desert-like surface. After completing its mission, Mariner 4 continued past Mars to the far side of the Sun. On December 20, 1967, all operations of the spacecraft were ended.\n\n<a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~5~5~23173~127285:First-Image-from-Mariner-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~5~5~23173~1272...</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "7928", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1965-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1376000143", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1343322793"}, "originalsecret": "5748d98fba", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8425", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/7651152780/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387642552}
