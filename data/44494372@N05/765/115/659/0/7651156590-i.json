It has been tentatively identified as Nix Olympica, a curious ring-shaped feature photographed by Mariners 6 and 7 in 1969 and a point which radar indicates is one of the highest on Mars. One possible explanation suggests a high mountain or plateau which is being seen as it rises up through the bright dust surrounding the rest of the planet. The picture, one of a series of 31 recorded on the first tape-load during approach to Mars, was taken at 8:46 a.m. PST, November 11, 1971, at a range of about 408,000 miles. North is at the top. \n\nMariner 9 was the first spacecraft to orbit another planet. The spacecraft was designed to continue the atmospheric studies begun by Mariners 6 and 7, and to map over 70% of the Martian surface from the lowest altitude (1500 kilometers [900 miles])and at the highest resolutions (1 kilometer per pixel to 100 meters per pixel) of any previous Mars mission. \n\nMariner 9 was launched on May 30, 1971 and arrived on November 14, 1971.\n\n<a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~4~4~10752~112744:Nix-Olympica-Identified-by-Mariner-\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~4~4~10752~1127...</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "9133", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1971-05-30 10:13:53", "lastupdate": "1385629157", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1343322833"}, "originalsecret": "59fb1ca216", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7275", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/7651156590/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387642517}
