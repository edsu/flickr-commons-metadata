In 1924, George Lewis, Max Munk and Fred Weick began to discuss an idea for a wind tunnel large enough to test a full-scale propeller. Munk sketched out a design for a tunnel with a 20-foot test section. The rough sketches were presented to engineers at Langley for comment. Elliott Reid was especially enthusiastic and he wrote a memorandum in support of the proposed &quot;Giant Wind Tunnel.&quot; At the end of the memorandum, he appended the recommendation that the tunnel test section should be increased to 30-feet diameter so as to allow full-scale testing of entire airplanes (not just propellers). Reid's idea for a full-scale tunnel excited many at Langley but the funds and support were not available in 1924. Nonetheless, Elliot Reid's idea would eventually become reality. In 1928, NACA engineers began making plans for a full-scale wind tunnel. In February 1929, Congress approved of the idea and appropriated $900,000 for construction. Located just a few feet from the Back River, pilings to support the massive building's foundation had to be driven deep into the earth. This work began in the spring of 1929 and cost $11,293.22.\n\n<b>Date: </b>03.14.1930\n<b>Credit: </b>NASA Langley Research Center (NASA-LaRC) [ <a href=\"http://lisar.larc.nasa.gov\" rel=\"nofollow\">lisar.larc.nasa.gov</a>]\n\n<b>ID: </b>EL-1999-00346\n<b>Other ID: </b>L4097\n<b>UID: </b>SPD-NIX-EL-1999-0034 6\n<b> Original url: </b><a href=\"http://nix.ksc.nasa.gov/info?id=EL-1999-00346&amp;orgid=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">nix.ksc.nasa.gov/info?id=EL-1999-00346&amp;orgid=1</a>\n\n<b>SOURCE</b>:  <a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~2~2~3402~104949\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~2~2~3402~104949</a>:\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "12403", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-08-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1376000545", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1283151601"}, "originalsecret": "1f10f81463", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4078", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/4861094343/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643541}
