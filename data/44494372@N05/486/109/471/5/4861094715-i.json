Of the original tunnels planned for Ames the 16ft had perhaps the highest priority. Assigned this precedence because it was to have a higher spped than any other major wind tunnel in the NACA and would provide aerodynamic data at speeds at which future military airplanes were expected t fly. It operated at speeds up to 680 mph, about 0.9 of the speed of sound and 4 times the cross-sectional area of the Langley 8ft tunnel. Its cost was nearly $2 million. The huge 27,000 horsepower drive motors generated so much heat that it required an air-exchange tower that replaced the heated air from the tunnel with the cool air from outdoors.\n\n<b>Date: </b>10/4/40\n<b>Source: </b><a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/Ails-g-59732-0-1e\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.archive.org/details/Ails-g-59732-0-1e</a>\n<b>Identifier: </b>Ails-g-59732-0-1e\n\n<b>Image ID: </b>135030\n\n<b>SOURCE</b>:  <a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/NVA2~31~31~78077~135030:G-597--32-0-1E\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/NVA2~31~31~78077~13503...</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "14326", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-08-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1376000544", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1283151601"}, "originalsecret": "6ab198e3f9", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4076", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/4861094715/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643530}
