In June, crews poured cement for the foundation of the Mechanical Vibration Facility (MVF) seismic mass, which is still under construction. The MVF is a part of the Space Power Facility, which also includes two large high-bays, an acoustics chamber and a vacuum chamber. The MVF will consist of an 18-foot diameter test table that will provide an area to test frequencies and vibration, and simulate the harsh mechanical vibration the Orion will experience during launch.
