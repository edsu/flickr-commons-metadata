From 1960 to 1964, the existing stands were remodeled and a sizable new test area was developed. The new comprehensive test complex for propulsion and structural dynamics was unique within the nation and the free world, and they remain so today because they were constructed with foresight to meet the future as well as on going needs. Construction of the S-IC Static test stand complex began in 1961 in the west test area of MSFC, and was completed in 1964. The S-IC static test stand was designed to develop and test the 138-ft long and 33-ft diameter Saturn V S-IC first stage, or booster stage, weighing in at 280,000 pounds. Required to hold down the brute force of a 7,500,000-pound thrust produced by 5 F-1 engines, the S-IC static test stand was designed and constructed with the strength of hundreds of tons of steel and 12,000,000 pounds of cement, planted down to bedrock 40 feet below ground level. The foundation walls, constructed with concrete and steel, are 4 feet thick. The base structure consists of four towers with 40-foot-thick walls extending upward 144 feet above ground level. The structure was topped by a crane with a 135-foot boom. With the boom in the upright position, the stand was given an overall height of 405 feet, placing it among the highest structures in Alabama at the time. In addition to the stand itself, related facilities were constructed during this time. Built directly east of the test stand was the Block House, which served as the control center for the test stand. The two were connected by a narrow tunnel which housed the cables for the controls. Again to the east, just south of the Block House, was a newly constructed Pump House. Its function was to provide water to the stand to prevent melting damage during testing. The water was sprayed through small holes in the stand?s 1900 ton water deflector at the rate of 320,000 gallons per minute. In this photograph, taken Aril 4, 1962, construction workers are busy in the Pump House area. The narrower area at the top center portion of the photo is the water line area. The circular area to the foreground is the drain through which the water would feed into the pipes for delivery to the stand.\n\n<b>Date of Image: </b>1962-04-04\n\n<b>Reference Number: </b>MSFC-75-SA-4105-2C\n<b>MIX #: </b>0600542\n<b>NIX #: </b>MSFC-0600542\n<b>MSFC Negative Number: </b>0600542\n<b>UID: </b>SPD-MARSH-0600542\n<b>Original url: </b><a href=\"http://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=3735\" rel=\"nofollow\">mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=3735</a>\n\n<b>SOURCE</b>:  <a href=\"http://nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~9~9~59591~163437\" rel=\"nofollow\">nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~9~9~59591~163437</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "13752", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-08-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1376000543", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1283151601"}, "originalsecret": "5b16609a81", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4121", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/4861714720/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643522}
