Dryden - portrait  \n\n<b>Description: </b>Dr. Hugh Latimer Dryden, had many titles after his name in his lifetime. In 1949 he became the director of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). Dr. Dryden received many accolades and awards both during his life and after his death, but the greatest and most appropriate honor came on March 26, 1976, when NASA renamed the NASA Flight Research Center as the NASA Hugh L. Dryden Flight Research Center. At the dedication ceremony NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher stated: &quot;in 1924, when the fastest racing planes did well to fly at 280 m.p.h., Dryden was already probing the transonic range of . . . flight. Later in the 1920s, he sought to develop methods of accurately measuring . . . turbulence in wind tunnels. In 1938 he was the first American to deliver the Wright Brothers lecture. His 'Turbulence and the Boundary Layer' became a classic summary on the subject. It is most fitting that this Flight Research Center, with its unique and highly specialized capability for solving aerospace problems, should memorialize the genius of Hugh Dryden.&quot; Dr. Dryden was initially an aerodynamicist with the National Bureau of Standards. He did important early work in high-speed aerodynamics. In 1947 he became the director of aeronautical research for the NACA (a predecessor of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration). Two years later, he became NACA's director, a position he held until 1958 when he became deputy administrator of NASA.  \n\n<b>Date: </b>01.01.1959  \n<b>Credit: </b>NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (NASA-DFRC) \n\n<b>ID: </b>E-4248  \n<b>UID:</b> SPD-NIX-E-4248  \n<b> Original url:</b> <a href=\"http://nix.ksc.nasa.gov/info?id=E-4248&amp;orgid=7\" rel=\"nofollow\">nix.ksc.nasa.gov/info?id=E-4248&amp;orgid=7</a>\n\n<b>SOURCE:</b> <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~2~2~3107~104650\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~2~2~3107~1...</a>\n\n<b>Visit <a href=\"http://www.nasaimages.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasaimages.org</a> for the most comprehensive compilation of NASA stills, film and video, created in partnership with Internet Archive. </b>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "11220", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-08-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1376000612", "takengranularity": "4", "posted": "1283151604"}, "originalsecret": "20c1ab13ae", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4035", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/4479013957/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387643339}
