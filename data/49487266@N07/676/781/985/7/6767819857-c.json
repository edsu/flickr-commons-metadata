The first, and I think most likely, is aboard USS Rendova (CVE-114) either during carrier qualifications or a little later during Operation Lex Baker I in February 1952. The two HRS's on the right are HRS-1's - I can tell by where &quot;MARINES&quot; is located on the booms. The second HRS-1 on the right has the modex HS and what looks like a 5 or 6 on the nose. That makes it HMR-162 based at MCAF Santa Ana. The second possibility would be aboard USS Valley Forge (CV-45) during the PHIBEX I exercise during October 1952.", "authorname": "sonofthor", "id": "49465936-6767819857-72157630090360320", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "6767819857"}, "flarchive:created": 1387761738}
