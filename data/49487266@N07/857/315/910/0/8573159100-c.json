This is because the fuselage is fabric-covered. The DFW C.V type had a plywood-covered fuselage and would've had not stitching. Also, the forward slanted struts w/ the top wing moved forward was a Rumpler feature. The DFW had struts that were vertical, not slanted forward. The top wing was aligned directly over the lower wing. On the Rumpler aircraft seen here, they are all slanted forward.", "authorname": "Aviatik IMG", "id": "49465936-8573159100-72157633042354191", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8573159100"}}
