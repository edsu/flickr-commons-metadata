His face is smeared with Frostsalbe (Frostbite prevention cream) and this photo was taken right before his fatal flight where during stunt maneuvers the forward portion of the aileron balance bent and failed causing the plane to go out of control. The ribs were not glued properly in the upper wing and had been weakened by a moist environment. He crashed hard and hit his face against the back of the bar of the twin machine guns and fractured his skull. He died shortly thereafter.", "authorname": "Aviatik IMG", "id": "49465936-8572068141-72157633044105427", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8572068141"}}
