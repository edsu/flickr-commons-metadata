This aircraft has the Cross of Lorraine on the tail so attached to the Free French but I believe not captured from the Vichy French until after Operation Torch (end 1942). The Free French had used the markings 'FL- 'from  1942 but swiftly changed that to' FC-'  but ' F-L' is new to me although the use of 3 letter suffixes like QBE was common.
