The wing root can be seen in the photo, and it's not &quot;kinked&quot; enough to be a P-51K (or P-51 D).  Also, even if you couldn't see the wing root, you'd probably not see a Hamilton Standard cuffed prop on a P-51K ... it came from the factory w/ an Aeroproducts propeller and it looks very different from this one.  They did, in the field sometimes, retrofit the Hamilton Standard to the P-51K, but it required changing the governor, controls, etc.  This was done because the Aeroproducts prop just seemed to defy balancing and this limited the speed of the aircraft - or so I'm told.\n\nI vote for a &quot;typo&quot; on this one.  Great photo, though!", "authorname": "TomLou1", "id": "49465936-8662776413-72157633375564482", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/8662776413/#comment72157633481281591", "realname": "Robert Bourlier", "path_alias": null, "author": "95731483@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1368567167", "_content": "This is a P-51C of the 118th TRS, 23rd FG.
