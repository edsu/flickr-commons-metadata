The dirigible was flown by <b>Roy Knabenshue</b>. Machines were continually modified and this picture shows the second modification fitted with a 8 hp (!) Curtiss engine. The location is Chutes Park in Los Angeles, a baseball station. We are looking in at 30 January 1905.\nFlyers in those times needed to be very courageous as they only could stand up on small wooden platform in the metal tube construction underneath the gas envelope.\nNewspapers of the time reported the marvel of flying extensively. As an example here is a reference to a report in the Los Angeles Herald which reports on the event and gives extra pictures covering the event.\n\n[<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042462/1905-01-30/ed-1/seq-3/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042462/1905-01-30/ed-...</a>]", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-9402344905-72157635196723168", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/9402344905/#comment72157635196174709", "realname": "SDASM Archives", "path_alias": "sdasmarchives", "author": "49487266@N07", "iconserver": "4070", "datecreate": "1377275188", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/varese2002] Great info, thanks!", "authorname": "San Diego Air & Space Museum Archives", "id": "49465936-9402344905-72157635196174709", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "9402344905"}}
