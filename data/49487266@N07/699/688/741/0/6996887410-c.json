It was scheduled to launch the Galileo probe to Jupiter.  In fact, in the upper left quadrant, the sign behind the viewing stand has a picture of Jupiter and Saturn.  There were many risks involving having a liquid fueled rocket in the shuttle's cargo bay: in the case of an abort, the explosive liquid fuel of the Centaur would have to be jettisoned.  Moreover, the increasing weight of the shuttle and the Centaur stage meant that the shuttle main engines would have to operate at 109% for part of the ascent phase.  The increase in risk was significant, but engineers and astronauts had signed off on it.  However, following the space shuttle Challenger explosion on January 28, 1986, the program was cancelled.", "authorname": "drewgranston", "id": "49465936-6996887410-72157638615071255", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "6996887410"}, "flarchive:created": 1387756111}
