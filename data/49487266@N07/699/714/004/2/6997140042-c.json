The actual serial number on the fuselage looks like 9403 which of course is impossible. If we then look closer on the McCook master list we find that P-143 was AS.94103. Since we also know that this master list DO contain errors, it is highly possible that P-143 and P-144 should be switched and P-143 in fact was AS.94102 and P-144 should read AS.94103. A bit puzzling is the year 1918 written on the photo, since P-143/144 were issued in 1919.\nStig", "authorname": "Avis1951", "id": "49465936-6997140042-72157629631723238", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "6997140042"}, "flarchive:created": 1387755513}
