Maer, Stinson Field, San Antonio TX.\n\n&quot;The Egg&quot; c.1924 = OmwM; 90hp Curtiss OX-5. A grotesque sort of machine, consisting of an egg-shaped fuselage with an underslung gondola and extra-long landing gear. One of several odd airplanes that could be found at Stinson Field at the time, the contrast between an elegant fuselage and the rest of the machinery makes one believe that the gondola and the landing gear were meant to be left on the ground\u2014a flying bomb? Engine was mounted in a cowl that looked much like a NACA cowl, not then invented, and its radiator was mounted on the outside of the cowl. The ship was said to be the brainchild of a German inventor, and one named Maer was known to be working at Stinson Field, but other sources credit it to a Prof Warner, who also designed an ornithopter. Things get more complicated than that. An Air Service Newsletter lists the plane as &quot;The Fly,&quot; designed and constructed by a Lt D B Phillips (SEE Phillips Alouette), assisted by members of the 3rd Attack Group. Reportedly was Charles Lindbergh who labeled it &quot;The Egg&quot; when he saw it.", "authorname": "PanopticPV", "id": "49465936-9955559394-72157635931282795", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "9955559394"}}
