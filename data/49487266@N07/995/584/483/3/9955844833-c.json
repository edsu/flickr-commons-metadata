There is some data that says Lindbergh stayed at Kelley's home when he was in San Diego during the spring of 1927. Kelley's grandson corroborates Lindbergh's housing with Kelley. He states, &quot;I can fully support the account of Lindbergh staying at my grandpas house. Actually the house belonged to my great grandmother and the story goes that he slept in a corner of the basement at her house. Lindbergh evidently loved her cooking also.&quot;\n\nLater in life he received the National Aeronautic Association Elder Statesman of Aviation Award for 1987. His home, built in 1929 in San Diego, CA, was designated in 2002 by the San Diego Historical Resources Board as an historic landmark.\ndmairfield.org", "authorname": "Konabish ~ Greg Bishop", "id": "49465936-9955844833-72157635925829195", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "9955844833"}}
