It flew for the first time on August 28, 1947, actually beating the YB-36 into the air by four months. Beryl Erickson was again at the controls. Although it had been decided that production B-36s should carry a defensive armament of sixteen 20-mm cannon, no armament was actually fitted to this aircraft. The B-36A featured the domed canopy first seeen on the YB-36 and it had the four-wheel landing gear system that had replaced the single-wheel main landing gear. However, an AN/APQ-23 bombing navigational radar was installed. This aircraft was only fitted with enough equipment for a flight to Wright Field in Ohio, where it was permanently grounded so that it could be structurally tested to destruction. It was permanently designated as YB-36A....&quot;\n\nJoe Baugher", "authorname": "Batman_60", "id": "49465936-8540662480-72157632975460985", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "8540662480"}}
