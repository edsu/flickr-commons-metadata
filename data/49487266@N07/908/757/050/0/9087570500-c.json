This aircraft was flown post-war by Dianna Bixby for an attempted around-the-world record flight in 1950, which was not successful due to engine trouble in India, but which was completed nonetheless.  It was later used by Flying Tiger Lines for photo mapping.  Seen here in US civil markings as N1203V.  Damaged beyond repair in a takeoff crash in Haiti in 1956.\n\nThis photo appears elsewhere on Flickr, cropped tighter and titled 'beaufighter 9'\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726157@N08/1842680039/]", "authorname": "Batman_60", "id": "49465936-9087570500-72157634323866948", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "9087570500"}}
