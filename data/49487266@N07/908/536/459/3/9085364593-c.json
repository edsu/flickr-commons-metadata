The fuselage was capacious enough to house the bulky experimental radar sets and the Boeing was used to develop Airborne Interception (AI) radar for use in night fighters. Later it was used for the development of Instrument Landing Systems until being scrapped some time after the end of the war. This was c/n 1726 ex NC13344, CF-TBA and RCAF 7655 before becoming DZ203 with the TRE at Defford. It was was finally scrapped in August 1947 at No 34 MU, Sleap, reportedly after being damaged in its hangar at Defford during winter storms in late in 1946.&quot;\n\nThere is a book written about DZ203 which I have on order, but it is shipping from the UK and has not yet arrived.\n&quot;Top Secret Boeing&quot; by Bob Shaw.", "authorname": "Batman_60", "id": "49465936-9085364593-72157634242455535", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "9085364593"}}
