The fair commemorated the end of World War II and was a showplace for the United States' new airpower. Many military aircraft were displayed, including several captured German and Japanese airplanes. Three years after the war, the United States Air Force was created as an organization independent from the Army Air Forces. This could not have been as quickly realized without the immense public interest in aviation generated by exhibits such as these. The three-page brochure is 10&quot; x 8&quot; (25.4 x 20.32 cm). \n<a href=\"http://www.ohiomemory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p267401coll36/id/868/rec/10\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ohiomemory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p267401c...</a>", "authorname": "Konabish ~ Greg Bishop", "id": "49465936-9257935642-72157634579359975", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "9257935642"}}
