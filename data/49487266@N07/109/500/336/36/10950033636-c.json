Dilling (3 victories) standing next to his Republic P-47D Thunderbolt, USAAF Ser. No. 42-8447, code &quot;HO-S&quot;, named &quot;Queen City Mama.&quot;  Contrary to the notation, Dilling was not actually &quot;shot down over Paris,&quot; but became lost in the fog during a mission over France on December 30, 1943, during which he ran out of fuel and was forced to make a gear up landing in northern France.  Dilling would abandon the aircraft in occupied territory, reportedly placing a grenade in the cockpit which failed to explode.  While Dilling would escape capture and make his way back to Bodney from France through Spain, &quot;Queen City Mama&quot; would be recovered and repaired by the Germans, and evaluated by the Luftwaffe while wearing Luftwaffe markings (possibly as T9+FK).\n\nSee book:\n<u>352nd Fighter Group</u>, by Thomas G.
