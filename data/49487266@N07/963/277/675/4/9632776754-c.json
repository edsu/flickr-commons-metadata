Prest (1896-1954) and built by Prest Airplane &amp; Motor Co. The machine was registered as X876K. Engine was a 45 hp Anzani. The machine was identified as the 'Baby Pursuit'. Probably because of the depression there was only one sample built. There are more pictures of this machine in the collection of E.G.Rowell.\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/9629540785/in/set-72157635306958286]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/9632775680/in/set-72157635306958286]\n\nIdentity could best be defined as the Prest Baby Pursuit (1929)", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-9632776754-72157635385498278", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "9632776754"}}
