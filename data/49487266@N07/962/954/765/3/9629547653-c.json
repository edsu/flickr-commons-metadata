The engine appears to be a Kinner B-5.  At first I thought it might be an early prototype version of a <a href=\"http://1000aircraftphotos.com/Contributions/Larkins/10759L.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">General Western P-2-S Meteor</a> with a smaller engine, but although the struts are similar, the wing shape, landing gear, and tail are different. This reg shows up only as a Cessna CG-2 glider, but this later re-use of 326M is totally absent from any searchable listings I know.
