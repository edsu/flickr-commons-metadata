Courtney (1894-1982) was born in London and was one of the few aviators that could make the claim that he was there for it all.  He started his career with an apprenticeship at the Grahame-White Aircraft Company in 1913 and attained his pilot\u2019s certificate in August 1914 flying primitive box-kite airplanes.  He attained the rank of Captain while serving in the Royal Flying Corps in WWI while flying in a Morane-Saulnier \u201cParasol.\u201d\n \nAfter the war Courtney became a test pilot for De Havilland and an avid air racer. The early 1920\u2019s saw Courtney pioneer airline service routes between Britain and the European Continent across the English Channel for Daimler Airways.  He was a part of numerous pioneering ventures: in 1925 Courtney tested and helped develop the newly invented autogir and in 1927 and 1928 he tried and failed on two separate occasions to prove the concept of an airline service route between Europe and North America by flying unsuccessfully across the Atlantic from east to west.\n \nIn 1928 Courtney came to the USA as a technical-assistant to the Curtiss-Wright Corporation, went back to England in 1936 to test hydroplanes, and returned to the USA 1940 to test planes for Convair.  During WWII he served as a ferry pilot routinely flying B-24\u2019s and PBY\u2019s for delivery.  After the war Courtney served as an advisor to Boeing and finished up his aviation career by participating in the development of the Atlas Missile.  He published an autobiography, The Eighth Sea, in 1972 through Doubleday publishing (Published as Flight Path in the UK).  He was married to Constance May \u201cGinger\u201d Filby (1901-1968).\n<b>Repository:</b> <a href=\"http://www.sandiegoairandspace.org/library/stillimages.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">San Diego Air and Space Museum Archive</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "812", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2013-11-22 13:51:20", "lastupdate": "1385202567", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1385157271"}, "originalsecret": "ed6c5bafe4", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3810", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/11000187533/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
