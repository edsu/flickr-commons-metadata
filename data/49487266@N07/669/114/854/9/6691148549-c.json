Both versions has a multi-faceted, stealthy fuselage, with shoulder-mounted wings, and twin fins angled sharply outwards. In order to minimise the radar cross-section (RCS) the engine was mounted low in the fuselage, and, while, the twin air intakes are in the conventional cheek position, the exhaust is above the fuselage and between the fins.\n\nSource: Jane's International Defence Review (Aug 01, 1995)", "authorname": "Stargazer 2006", "id": "49465936-6691148549-72157633821469878", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "6691148549"}, "flarchive:created": 1387763458}
