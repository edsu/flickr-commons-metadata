Not only was the\nUnited States interested in a cruise that would culminate in a great gesture of\namity toward Australia and New Zealand, but there was even more excitement\nin those islands; Australia went to the extent of sending its only official\nrepresentative in the United States to speed the fleet on its way, while San\nFrancisco made every effort to honor the country's departing convoy.\nOf the many parties that were tendered the fleet, the one that most impressed\nme was the luncheon the Australian Commissioner gave for the admirals and\ncaptains. While it differed little from other luncheons of international character,\nincluding the speeches, the one given by the Australian Commissioner was quite\ndifferent and amazing, for after voicing Australia's welcome to the fleet, he added\nwords to this effect: &quot;Officers of the fleet, you should not allow yourselves to\ngauge Australia's welcome to the fleet by San Francisco's marvelous farewell. I\nconcede the spontaneousness of that and realize that as a city San Francisco is\nmost generous to the fleet. But last night as I walked down Market Street, I\nrealized that something was missing when I saw groups of handsome, young\nsailors and groups of San Francisco's lovely girls parading Market Street, allowing\nonly glances at each other. Your strict American custom demanded formal\nintroductions, and without them, they could not meet one another.&quot;\n&quot;Thank Heaven, you will not find introductions necessary in Australia. When\nyour young men encounter Australia's young ladies in Sydney or Melbourne,\nthey will be taken right to their bosoms, and I mean that literally as well as\nfiguratively. Permit me to suggest, gentlemen, that you advise your men\naccordingly.&quot;\nNeedless to say, the interest in the cruise was intensified to some extent after\nthat speech, and it may be that all minds in the fleet were not on our war games\nwhen we stood out of the Golden Gate. But if such were the case, it was not\napparent. The fleet worked its hardest on the battle problem for some six weeks\nand seemed to think of nothing else. A royal welcome awaited us everywhere we\nstopped along our way to Australia.&quot;", "authorname": "JimLey.com", "id": "49465936-6692086837-72157630084655546", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "6692086837"}, "flarchive:created": 1387761778}
