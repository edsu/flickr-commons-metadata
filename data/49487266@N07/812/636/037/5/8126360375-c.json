Kennedy International Airport (JFK / KJFK) in New York.  The aircraft  is jetBlue A320 (A320-232) N503JB (c/n 1123) &quot;Bluebird&quot; and here it is at rest on Runway 22R after its nose gear failed to deploy properly.\n\nThe confusion in the caption is understandable, as a similar incident would occur almost three years later when jetBlue A320 N536JB (c/n 1784) &quot;Canyon Blue&quot; made an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on September 21, 2005 with its nose gear wheels jammed perpendicular to its normal deployed position. \n\nAs in the incident illustrated above, a safe landing was made with no harm coming to any passengers or crew.", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "49465936-8126360375-72157632036223020", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "8126360375"}}
