This number was usually composed of the last three digits of the registration number for Pan Am's CV-240 fleet.  In this case, &quot;Clipper Bahamas&quot; would have the registration NC90659 (N90659).\n\nHowever, see this photo of the Christening of the Pan Am Convair 240 named &quot;Clipper Cuba&quot;:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/8126166013/in/photostream/]\n\nAlthough not as apparent, &quot;Clipper Cuba&quot; wears &quot;659&quot; on the nose gear doors as well.  \n\nWe do know that Clipper Cuba wore the registration NC60659 (N60659, c/n 34) and was delivered to Pan American Airways on April 28, 1948.  \n\nIt was not uncommon for Pan Am change the &quot;Clipper&quot; name of aircraft for various reasons.  I suspect that &quot;Clipper Bahamas&quot; was a name of temporary convenience for NC60659 (c/n 34) for public relations and promotional reasons as it began its new service to the Bahamas.  Of course, the same could be said for the use of the name &quot;Clipper Cuba&quot;. . .", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "49465936-8126166009-72157633356730555", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "8126166009"}}
