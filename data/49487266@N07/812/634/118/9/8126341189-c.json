I believe this is was taken post-1947 because the streetcar lines on 16th are visible, but they are paved over as they turn onto Broadway. With few exceptions almost every building in this photograph is long gone. San Diego City College has built on two of the blocks shown above.", "authorname": "chulo_2", "id": "49465936-8126341189-72157632632337177", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/8126341189/#comment72157635370261972", "realname": "Gregory M.", "path_alias": null, "author": "40579823@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1378237753", "_content": "Campbell Chevrolet is at 1600 Broadway", "authorname": "gregoryagogogo", "id": "49465936-8126341189-72157635370261972", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8126341189"}}
