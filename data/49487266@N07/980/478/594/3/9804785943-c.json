Irvine and his crew made an unrefueled non-stop 9,500-mile flight from Honolulu to Cairo, Egypt, over the Arctic regions in 39 hours, 36 minutes. The route was chosen for its hazards of winter weather and complicated navigation and communications problems. \n\nThe Boeing B-29B was a modification of the basic B-29 design for use in the Pacific during World War II for low-level bombing raids against Japan. Fighter opposition over Japan was minimal by late 1944 and flak was the most serious threat to U.S. bombers. The B-29B had all defensive armament removed except for the tail turret. The 20mm cannon was removed and the two .50-cal. machine guns were aided by the installation of an AN/APG-15B radar fire control system. Bell aircraft built 311 -B models at their Marietta, Ga., plant between January and September 1945.", "authorname": "Konabish ~ Greg Bishop", "id": "49465936-9804785943-72157635632678386", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "9804785943"}}
