My father had a tonette in WWII.  He was in the Air Force, stationed in Persia, and talked about playing it there, especially for a young Persian boy that he befriended.  He brought the tonette home with him, and often entertained his children and grandchildren with it.  I had assumed he originally brought it to Persia from the U.S., but maybe he received it there (for &quot;R and &quot;R).  His tonette says High Tone Songflute on it.", "authorname": "werth_julie", "id": "49465936-7212074912-72157633837442919", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7212074912"}, "flarchive:created": 1387729110}
