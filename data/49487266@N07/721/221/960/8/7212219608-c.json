I found a British pilot, Second Lieutenant George C. Mills, Special Reserves, listed in Flight magazine, 27 January 1916; in that case, RFC = Royal Flying Corps.\n\nUnfortunately (if this is that same GC Mills), there's a further report of his death in the 8 November 1917 issue of the same magazine:\n&quot;Lieut. G. C. Mills, RFC, was making an aeroplane flight in South Hampshire on Sunday, and when about 600 ft. up his machine came into collision with another aeroplane.  The former crashed to the ground, and Lieut. Mills was picked up dead.  The officer in the second aeroplane effected a safe landing.&quot;", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "49465936-7212219608-72157629762998018", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "7212219608"}, "flarchive:created": 1387728994}
