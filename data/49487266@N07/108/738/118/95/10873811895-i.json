He formed Eaton Brothers Aircraft with his brother Frank and they built several aircraft together.  Warren teamed with Lincoln Beachy and barnstormed with him.  He also built some of Beachy's airplanes.  Later, he assisted Glenn Curtiss with the design of amphibian aircraft.  When the U.S. Government established licensing for pilots, Warren Eaton was issued License Number 85. \n     A short time later, at the beginning of WWI, Warren was employed by the U.S. Army Air Service at what is now Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  \n     After the war, he went to work for Universal Pictures and developed miniatures to be used in movies. He built a set of San Francisco which was used to depict the destruction of the city during the 1906 Earthquake. He also constructed a copy of the Notre Dame Cathedral used in the \u201cHunchback of Notre Dame\u201d movie.<b>Repository:</b> <a href=\"http://www.sandiegoairandspace.org/library/stillimages.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">San Diego Air and Space Museum Archive</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2283", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2013-11-15 11:11:20", "lastupdate": "1384755518", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1384542680"}, "originalsecret": "7db5228784", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7430", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/10873811895/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
