It was assigned to 330 Squadron in July, 1944. In 1945 it was delivered to Shorts at Belfast for conversion to a Sandringham.  The converted airliner was delivered to TEAL September 4, 1946, flying its first TEAL scheduled service on September 17, 1946. It flew the first  Sandringham flight to Fiji in May 1947, and made the last TEAL scheduled service on December 19, 1949. Subsequently, it was sold to Barrier Reef Airways in 1950, registered as VH-BRD and renamed 'Princess of Cairns'. Barrier Reef operated it between Brisbane, Townsville and Cairns and various offshore islands. The aircraft sank in the Brisbane river after being damaged at its mooring by a ship on September 10, 1952. It was salvaged, but sank again while under tow to Coolangatta in 1954 (where it was to become a nightclub).  The wreckage was never recovered.\n<img src=\"http://www.aussieairliners.org/shortfb/vh-brd/2545.330l.jpg\" />\n<img src=\"http://www.aussieairliners.org/shortfb/vh-brd/2545.342l.jpg\" />\n<img src=\"http://www.aussieairliners.org/shortfb/vh-brd/2545.295l.jpg\" />\nBelow, as VH-BRD.\n<img src=\"http://www.aussieairliners.org/shortfb/vh-brd/2545.296l.jpg\" />.\n<img src=\"http://i914.photobucket.com/albums/ac346/TASSE_2009/scan006.jpg\" />", "authorname": "Batman_60", "id": "49465936-7449868084-72157630350401660", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "7449868084"}, "flarchive:created": 1387722802}
