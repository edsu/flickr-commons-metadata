This is actually a U-2C model that NASA had in from 1971 until its retirement in 1987.  This is 56-6681 NASA tail 708.  Also the &quot;meat ball&quot; that you see on the intake was never applied to the ER-2 aircraft.  Only the modern meatball like you see on 806 and 809 that is flying today.  The way you can tell a U-2C from a U-2R model is the U-2C has the buldged intakes and a canoe on the spine from the tail to the Q-bay.  NASA's ER-2s are much larger than this.  At one time NASA had an ER-2 708 80-1069 but it was returned to the Air Force in 1997 when the program left for Dryden Flight Research Center.", "authorname": "flyboy80099", "id": "49465936-8539559837-72157634394654697", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/8539559837/#comment72157634399714330", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "46217063@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1372546697", "_content": "One last thing, we are restoring the aircraft you see in this photo at Moffett Field.
