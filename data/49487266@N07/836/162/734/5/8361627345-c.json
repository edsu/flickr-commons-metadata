Throughout the Exposition, Ford was assembling automobiles along the outer rings and used the courtyard area as a showroom to display the latest models. The newly assembled vehicles were rolled out the large doors on the west side. There was also a test track called &quot;Roads To The Pacific&quot; set up down the hill behind the building which overlooks Highway 395 where visitors could take one of the latest models for a test drive.&quot;", "authorname": "Konabish ~ Greg Bishop", "id": "49465936-8361627345-72157632475020466", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "8361627345"}}
