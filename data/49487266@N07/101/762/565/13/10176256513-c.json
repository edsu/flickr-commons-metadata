Like its successors, the S.VII was renowned as a sturdy and rugged aircraft with good climbing and diving characteristics. It was also a stable gun platform, although pilots used to the more manoeuvrable Nieuport fighters found it heavy on the controls. It was flown by a number of the famous aces, such as France's Georges Guynemer, Italy's Francesco Baracca and Australia's Alexander Pentland.", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "49465936-10176256513-72157636436166115", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "10176256513"}}
