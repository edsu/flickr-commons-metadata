Roland D.VIb with serial 6142/18. This machine was from a series of 50 machines ordered in September 1918 with the serials D 6100/18 - D 6149/18. This is a brand new machine which probably never saw action and was handed over according to the armistice terms. The collection of Corporal Richard M. Denbo is so interesting as it documents the enormous number of machines handed in according to these terms. \n\nThis A.S.P.C. [Air Service Production Center] was one of the concentration points where machines were stored and eventually transported further to the USA or scrapped (or sold for scrap) in France.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-10176182456-72157636416892835", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "10176182456"}}
