As the name suggests, it was the home of Seversky, and then Republic Aviation.   The hangar in the photo is still there and remains in operation today.   To the north (the left side of the frame), is the current location of the American Airpower Museum.\n\nThe view is looking from west to east.  The runway next to the hangar is Runway 19.  The property to the east of the hangar is St. Charles Cemetery.  New Highway runs north and south to the east of Runway 19, and in between the airport and cemetery property.", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "49465936-6432985865-72157628226426951", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/6432985865/#comment72157628246581551", "realname": "", "path_alias": "hanys", "author": "33731812@N02", "iconserver": "7242", "datecreate": "1322833842", "_content": "I think I've read the 1st word written with smaller lettering.
