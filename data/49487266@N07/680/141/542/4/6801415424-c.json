The airship was powered by gaseous fuel called &quot;Blau gas&quot; (propane), which was the same density as air, and therefore did not lighten the airship as fuel was burned.  With Blau gas tons of weight was saved and no hydrogen needed to be vented to make up for the weight reduction that would have occured with liquid fuel.", "authorname": "Batman_60", "id": "49465936-6801415424-72157629499278343", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "6801415424"}, "flarchive:created": 1387760120}
