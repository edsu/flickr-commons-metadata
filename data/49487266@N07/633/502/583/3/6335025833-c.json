The particular aircraft in the photo would win (with Lt. Russell Maughan at the controls) the Pulitzer Trophy during the 1922 National Air Races held at Selfridge Field, Michigan.  The following year, Lt. Maughan would set a new international speed record of 236.5 mph flying the very same aircraft.  This R-6 would be destroyed in a fatal air crash at the National Air Races at Wilbur Wright Field (present day Wright Patterson AFB)  on October 4, 1924, killing pilot Capt. Burt E. Skeel.  Reports state the wings broke away from the aircraft while Skeel was flying at 2,000-ft, sending the aircraft into a dive into the ground at a speed in excess of 285 mph.", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "49465936-6335025833-72157628115152978", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "6335025833"}, "flarchive:created": 1387766215}
