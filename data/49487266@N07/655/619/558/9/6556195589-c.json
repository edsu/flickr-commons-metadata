Also the engine is a 2 or 4-cylinder engine (no Anzani), most likely a Dutheil-Chambers which was built in a horizontal 2-cylinder version of 20 hp (air cooled).\n\nSurely the machine superficially looks like a Bl\u00e9riot monoplane (Type XI) but it is not a Bl\u00e9riot as none of them was fitted with the mentioned horizontal engine. Further I seem to see different details in the wing (very deep) and the way the wing warping is accomplished (two pyramidal constructions above the fuselage).\n\nEverything hints to one of the many contemporary builders who based their machine of the Bl\u00e9riot Type XI and made their own adjustments to 'upgrade' it.
