Like typical modern air craft, the &quot;primary&quot; control wings are in the back, but there also seems to be a &quot;secondary&quot; control wing in the front \u2014 so it's almost like a hybrid design between the Wright Flyer and that which came later. \n\nWhen I was looking for this plane the other day, I was also thinking it resembles a Wright Flyer, but I wasn't able to find any photos of any of their planes that looked like a match for this one. The closest plane I was able to find is the <a href=\"http://www.pioneeraeroplanes.com/3farm.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Farman Biplane</a>, which in all major structural details \u2014 landing skids with four wheels in a row, fore &amp; aft control wings, a single vertical rudder wing at the aft, etc \u2014 seems to be a match for the one in this photo. The Wikipedia article on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farman_III\" rel=\"nofollow\">Farman Biplane</a> says it descends from the design of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voisin_1907_biplane\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Voisin 1907 biplane</a>, and from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Voisin-Farman_I.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia's photo</a>, there are <i>some</i> similarities, but also some differences (only seems to have two wheels, different construction of the fore &amp; aft assemblies, etc):\n\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Voisin-Farman_I.jpg\" />\n\nMy best guess is still Farman III Biplane.", "authorname": "Chris Devers", "id": "49465936-6556195527-72157628702059763", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/6556195527/#comment72157628702214833", "realname": "SDASM Archives", "path_alias": "sdasmarchives", "author": "49487266@N07", "iconserver": "4070", "datecreate": "1325615763", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/cdevers] I think you are correct!
