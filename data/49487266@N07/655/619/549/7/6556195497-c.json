It almost looks like something from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bl%c3%a9riot_A%c3%a9ronautique\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bl\u00e9riot</a>, with the broad tail wings like that, but I'm having trouble finding one that seems to be a match. The closest could be the <a href=\"http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/bleriot.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bl\u00e9riot, II</a>, but that seemed to have vertical fabric segments between the upper &amp; lower wings in both the main &amp; tail wings, and the plane in this photo doesn't seem to be like that:\n\n<img src=\"http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/images/blerpeg_II_jul05_500.jpg\" />\n\nAlso, the plane in that photo is a flying boat, and this one has wheels. So there's that, too.
