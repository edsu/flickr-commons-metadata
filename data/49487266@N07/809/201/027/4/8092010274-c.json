It was taken in November 1943 at Dobodura, New Guinea, while assigned to the 400th Bombardment Squadron, 90th Bombardment Group, 5th Army Air Force.  Why it was labeled &quot;7th Air Force&quot;, especially since we did not have an &quot;Air Force&quot; at that time, I  do not know.  I'm thinking one might wish to regard the labeling of these photos with just a bit of skepticism; and where errors are found, kindly post the correct data.", "authorname": "MarstonMat", "id": "49465936-8092010274-72157632897690161", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8092010274"}}
