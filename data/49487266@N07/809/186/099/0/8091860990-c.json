Leach is, or rather was, a very quiet and retiring young fellow who always acted very much the part of a gentleman. He was formerly an ambulance man, but when the U.S. declared war, be entered our aviation service. I became acquainted with him in the flying school at Tours, where he finished satisfactorily and went to Issoudun for the aerobatics and finishing work.
