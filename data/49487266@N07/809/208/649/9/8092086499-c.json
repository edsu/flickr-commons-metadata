The picture may have been taken fro the roof of St Pauls Cathedral, In the distance is Tower Bridge, on the River Thames, and in front of that, the long shape crossing 1/2 the frame is Cannon Street Station and the railway lines heading south. Just to the left of Tower Bridge the The Monument (to the Great Fire of London 1666), and the Tower of London can be seen a little further right in the far distance. The white square tower approx 1/4 from left and 1/3 from top is St Mary's Aldermanbury. The little white tower right by the railway is St Michael Paternoster Hall.", "authorname": "Marishka von Saatz", "id": "49465936-8092086499-72157634388180627", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "8092086499"}}
