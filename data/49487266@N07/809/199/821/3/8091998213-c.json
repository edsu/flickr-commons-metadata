This may to be an oldest version of P-38 too (i.e. J-25) because doesn't have any signs of an adhesive tape ( they were permanently washed out during a service) and had a serious damage on the nose, maybe in combat. Another P-38 in this set is nearly a factory fresh P-38L-5 with very good visible signs of adhesive tape. Because a photographer from an another unit did both photos probably at one time then these both P-38's probably were assigned to the unit in two different periods, but this is just a speculation ;-)", "authorname": "ats42", "id": "49465936-8091998213-72157632215612083", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/8091998213/#comment72157632215681577", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "89986708@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1355186060", "_content": "Looking at this from a different point is worth to say, that it can to be a serial number painted especially in the unit because an original was obscured.
