He came to Palestine after some intrigue/upheaval at Jasta Boelcke where his low victory score was claimed as a sign of poor leadership by some pilots under his command. (Ltn. Werner Voss, among them). All parties involved were transferred out, Walz coming to Palestine as leader of Flieger-Abteilung 304b. He served there as an effective leader and was awarded the Pour le Merite.
