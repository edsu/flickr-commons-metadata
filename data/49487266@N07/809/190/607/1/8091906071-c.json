Menckhoff. This is Offz-Stellv. Walter G\u00f6ttsch of Jasta 8, who later led Jasta 19 and was shot down in Fokker Dr.I triplane 419/17. The aircraft is an Albatros D.II. The photo was retouched prior to publishing the card. The side radiator was retouched out, hence the light area right by G\u00f6ttsch's head that doesn't quite match the rest of the fuselage.", "authorname": "Aviatik IMG", "id": "49465936-8091906071-72157632699157620", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8091906071"}}
