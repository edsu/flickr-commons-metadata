Nungesser was a renowned ace in France, rating third highest in the country for air combat victories during World War I.\nAfter the war, Nungesser mysteriously disappeared on an attempt to make the first non-stop transatlantic flight from Paris to New York, flying with wartime comrade Fran\u00e7ois Coli in The White Bird (L'Oiseau Blanc). Their aircraft took off from Paris on 8 May 1927, was sighted once more over Ireland, and then was never seen again. The disappearance of Nungesser is considered one of the great mysteries in the history of aviation, and modern speculation is that the aircraft was either lost over the Atlantic or crashed in Newfoundland or Maine.[2] Two weeks after Nungesser and Coli's attempt, Charles Lindbergh successfully made the journey, flying solo from New York to Paris in Spirit of St. Louis. Monuments and museums honoring Nungesser and Coli's attempt exist at the Le Bourget airport in Paris and on the cliffs of \u00c9tretat, the location from which their plane was last sighted in France.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Nungesser\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Nungesser</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "49465936-8091888849-72157631976764443", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "8091888849"}}
