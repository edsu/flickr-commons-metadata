It was originally called the Salle des Capucines because of its location on the Boulevard des Capucines in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, but soon became known as the Palais Garnier in recognition of its opulence and its architect, Charles Garnier. The theatre was also often referred to as the Op\u00e9ra Garnier, the Op\u00e9ra de Paris or simply the Op\u00e9ra. It was the primary home of the Paris Opera and its associated Paris Opera Ballet until 1989, when a new 2,700-seat house, the Op\u00e9ra Bastille, with elaborate facilities for set and production changes, opened at the Place de la Bastille. The Paris Opera now mainly uses the Palais Garnier for ballet.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palais_Garnier\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palais_Garnier</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "49465936-8091886072-72157631992717494", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "8091886072"}}
