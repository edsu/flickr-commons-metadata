The &quot;23&quot; signifies that it is a 23-meter type giving the wing area measurement. The real Type  23 was a development of the Nieuport 17 fighter and was virtually indistinguishable except for the placement of the Vickers machine gun on the foreward fuselage upper decking in front of the pilot. On the 17 it was mounted centrally. On the 23 it was mounted offset to starboard, just off-center. In the training role the Nieuport fighters used for advanced training were often referred to by the wing area. Type 11 was the &quot;13-metre,&quot; The 17 and 23s were the &quot;15-metre&quot; and the 18 to 23 metre types were modified Nieuport 10 or 12s with variations in the wing area.", "authorname": "Aviatik IMG", "id": "49465936-8091854073-72157632891097996", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8091854073"}}
