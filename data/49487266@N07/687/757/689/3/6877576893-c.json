OTOH this is a wind tunnel model, which won't always match what got built since they are used to test different ideas (which could well have included larger flaps and other aerodynamic tweaks). \nIt is not a Hawk (single engined) or a YA-9 (high wing) nor a T-38 (which has 2 engines, but nothing else in common) though.", "authorname": "flickrdownldr", "id": "49465936-6877576893-72157630901648164", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "6877576893"}, "flarchive:created": 1387760922}
