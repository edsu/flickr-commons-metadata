At the time of the photograph, she was equipped as a VIP transport aircraft.  There was even a couch in the bomb bay section that when seated, one could look at America through small windows on the port (left) side of the aircraft.  It had a galley, captains swivel chairs in the blister windows, as well as a toilet at the very rear of the ship. She was also equipped with Dual Exhausts to make the Wright 2600s quieter for the occupants.  She was quite the machine of its day.  I believe that the only other B-25 that was modified with an air-stair door on the left side of the fuselage was N10V a B-25H (equippe with a J model nose) that is with the EAA. N37 was last known to be on display at the Kalamazoo Aviation History Museum, in Kalamazoo, Michagan.  go and see her if you get the chance.\ngary1954 - WIX member", "authorname": "gary4336", "id": "49465936-8318784263-72157633355090623", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8318784263"}}
