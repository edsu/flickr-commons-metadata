L.E. Thompson&quot;) actually matches the name of the naval aviator in the cockpit (which it may very well not),  then this would be Lieutenant Louis E. Thompson (USN).  He's listed as the 285th US Navy jet pilot (based on order of first jet flight) in the publication <u>United States Naval Aviation 1910-1995</u>, by Roy A. Grossnick, Naval Historical Center - Department of the Navy (1995) - ISBN 0-945274-34-3.  \n<a href=\"http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/usna1910.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.history.navy.mil/branches/usna1910.htm</a>\n\nAppendix 30 of the publication, entitled &quot;List of Early Naval Jet Pilots&quot; (Page 743), features the listing of Lt. Thompson as naval jet pilot No. 285.  It lists his first jet flight as taking place on February 6, 1948, in a North American FJ-1 Fury (the same type of aircraft in the photo above).\nSee:\n<a href=\"http://www.history.navy.mil/avh-1910/APP30.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.history.navy.mil/avh-1910/APP30.PDF</a>\n\nFurther, only 30 FJ-1 Fury aircraft were procured by the Navy.  Most operating out of North Island.  The FJ-1s that actually operated aboard an aircraft carrier belonged to VF-5A (which became VF-51 on August 16, 1948), who operated the FJ-1 off of USS Boxer (CV-21) beginning in March 1948.\n\nFlickr member aeroman3 (<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/my_public_domain_photos/\">www.flickr.com/photos/my_public_domain_photos/</a>) has a number of photos of this particular aircraft with Lt. Thompson's name stenciled on it, but with VF-51 Commanding Officer Commander Pete Aurand (Evan P. &quot;Pete&quot; Aurand, Naval Jet Pilot No. 128) operating it from USS Boxer in March 1948.\nSee:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/my_public_domain_photos/6143434630/&quot;&gt;www.flickr.com/photos/my_public_domain_photos/6143434630/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/my_public_domain_photos/6143434628/&quot;&gt;www.flickr.com/photos/my_public_domain_photos/6143434628/]", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "49465936-6420844461-72157628252780845", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "6420844461"}, "flarchive:created": 1387765555}
