The same aircraft would be modified into the prototype of the more successful XF4F-3 variant, which featured a Curtiss Electric propeller.\n\nThis said, there appears to be some sort of modification/repair of the engine cowling.  If the cowling's appearance is the result of a repair, the repair likely came after the aircraft made a forced landing alongside the Delaware River on April 11, 1938 during Navy trials.   Reportedly the tail, right wing, landing gear, cowling, and propeller suffered heavy damage in the forced landing.  Remarkably, repairs were made and the aircraft was flying again <b>two weeks</b> later.", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "49465936-6420844513-72157628198436551", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/6420844513/#comment72157628208101011", "realname": "SDASM Archives", "path_alias": "sdasmarchives", "author": "49487266@N07", "iconserver": "4070", "datecreate": "1322589803", "_content": "Thanks!
