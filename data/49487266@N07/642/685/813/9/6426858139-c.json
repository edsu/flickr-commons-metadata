The cooling fins just visible on the cylinder at the center of the image suggest a Twin Wasp, but the rocker cover plates and tapered gear case are unusual.   Possibly an early version, as most have bell shaped nose cases.  Missing ignition harness is also misleading.\n\nOr is it an R-1535 Twin Wasp Junior?  Most of these had reinforcing ribs cast into the nose gear casing, but I have seen one picture of a (later?) version without them.", "authorname": "Batman_60", "id": "49465936-6426858139-72157628214730599", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/6426858139/#comment72157629909077500", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "76863906@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1338066837", "_content": "1535 methinks, only missing the cooling plates between the cylinders.  the two rows of cyl appear 'nested' as only i have seen on the 1535 in our basement.", "authorname": "krztalizer", "id": "49465936-6426858139-72157629909077500", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "6426858139"}, "flarchive:created": 1387765517}
