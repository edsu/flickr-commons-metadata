The Pioneer could carry 36 passengers or five tons of cargo and first flew on 21 December 1946. The aircraft had a good performance, but there was little interest due to the availability of cheap war surplus aircraft. The Pioneer was lost in a fatal crash in 1947. In 1948 the United States Air Force expressed interest in an aircraft of the same configuration and placed an order with Northrop for 23 aircraft, 13 troop transports designated the C-125A Raider and 10 for Arctic rescue work designated the C-125B. With the company designation N-32 Raider the first aircraft flew on 1 August 1949.(Wikipedia)", "authorname": "Water tower nut", "id": "49465936-6385057393-72157628186185039", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/6385057393/#comment72157628188036687", "realname": "carlosbezz", "path_alias": "artlandstudio", "author": "22694125@N02", "iconserver": "7427", "datecreate": "1322478206", "_content": "Congratulations!\nThis is a wonderful shot!\nYou are invited to post it to: \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/artland/\"> <img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3447/3789880871_7381296df7_m.jpg \" /></a>\n<b> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/artland/\">artland </a></b>", "authorname": "artland", "id": "49465936-6385057393-72157628188036687", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/6385057393/#comment72157628191298917", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "25695066@N00", "iconserver": "7037", "datecreate": "1322496116", "_content": "This particular aircraft is Northrop YC-125A  Raider (USAF Ser.
