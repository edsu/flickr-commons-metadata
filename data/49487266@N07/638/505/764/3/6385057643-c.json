XA-BEW, c/n 7W-3).  Originally registered as NC13994, it was sold to a purchaser in Mexico, along with at least four other Spartan 7Ws, possibly for use in the Spanish Republican Air Force in the Spanish Civil War.  Ultimately, only one of the five made it to Spain.   XA-BEW's ultimate fate is unknown.\n\nOn the right is the second production Spartan 7W Executive built (reg. NC13993, c/n 7W-2).  Purchased originally by the A.D. Olson Drilling Company of Oklahoma.  The badge on its engine cowl says &quot;Torborkelson Fifth&quot; and features a winged helmet at its center (see another SDASM photo of the same aircraft below).  \n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/6385057477/in/photostream/]\n\nToday this very same aircraft is on exhibit at the EAA AirVenture Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, albeit painted in the colors of the 34th and last Spartan Executive built (c/n 7W-34), &quot;Mrs. Mennen.&quot;\nPhoto credit: dlberek\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/23269353@N00/5127586950/]", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "49465936-6385057643-72157628148983243", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "6385057643"}, "flarchive:created": 1387765565}
