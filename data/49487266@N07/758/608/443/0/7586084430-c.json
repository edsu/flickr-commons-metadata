When setting it correct there is the identification Otto No.92, meaning this was the 92nd machine produced by the Otto Flugzeugwerke. This machine was in service with the Bavarian Fliegertruppe (in German : K\u00f6nigliche Bayerische Fliegertruppe) and acquired a registration on the rudder, unfortunately not seen. The pusher biplane seems to have had a very hard landing as the complete left part of the two-wheel undercarriage has been smashed. \n\nA short caption of this picture could be Otto Pusher Biplane c/n 92 in service with the Bavarian Fliegertruppe around 1912/1913.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-7586084430-72157636078699865", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7586084430"}, "flarchive:created": 1387665931}
