Since they knew nothing of its history they assumed it must have been a British Beardmore built example and proceeded to butcher the airframe, modifying the ailerons to remove washout, creating a new fin and rudder and changing the engine to a Clerget (which their references said was the only engine that was supposed to have been used), and adding a Scarf gun ring. The restoration returned it to its original appearance (aluminium doped overall and in French markings), and even re-united it with the original engine it had when it arrived in Canada.", "authorname": "flickrdownldr", "id": "49465936-7586050098-72157630886536998", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7586050098"}, "flarchive:created": 1387666328}
