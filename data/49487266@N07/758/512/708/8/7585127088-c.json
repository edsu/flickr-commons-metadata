The aircraft closest to the camera is that of the squadron leader (Jastaf\u00fchrer) Ltn. August Raben. Raben is the German word for &quot;raven&quot; and so the insignia was a nicely detailed stencil of a raven. The squadron leader's aircraft has the vermillion color painted further back right before the tailplane. His raven is painted white, while all other aircraft are marked with black ravens and have a shorter front area of the fuselage painted vermillion red. The aircraft farthest on the right survived the war and is seen being test flown by American Air Service pilots. The aircraft are neatly lined up for an inspection by the commanding general of the L\u00fcftstreitkr\u00e4fte.
