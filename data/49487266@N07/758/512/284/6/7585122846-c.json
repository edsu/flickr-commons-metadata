The Fokker D.VII second from the left with the white rear fuselage and dark forward fuselage is from Jasta 18, Staffel Raben. The front portion of the aircraft and wings were painted vermillion. The rear portion of the fuselage was painted white. The horizontal stabilizer was painted black. The squadron marking on the aircraft is a black raven stenciled on both sides. The pilot's personal marking is a black chevron facing forward. Jasta 18 was one of the most striking looking squadrons in the air. The Fokker on the far right has as dark tailplane w/ to longitudinal white stripes. This is often seen on aircraft of Jasta 80b (although other Jastas also used similar markings).", "authorname": "Aviatik IMG", "id": "49465936-7585122846-72157631012833492", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/7585122846/#comment72157631012961324", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "77345821@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1344669127", "_content": "Check this link for a view of Jasta 18 Fokker D.VIIs during the Summer of 1918.If you look hard enough on the right-hand side, you'll see this Fokker D.VII in the photo before it was appropriated by the Allies.
