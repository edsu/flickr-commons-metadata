G\u00fcnther von B\u00fcren, a pilot with Jasta 18. His aircraft is in the vermillion red and white color scheme of the unit. All aircraft of the unit were painted in this scheme with a black raven stenciled on the side. Each pilot had an additional personal marking painted on the fuselage. In this case, von B\u00fcren's insignia are fat chicks ready to be plucked by his raven. The upper wing surfaces are also pained in the squadron color of vermillion red. The crosses appear to be white without the normal black painted inside of the white narrow outlines. Perhaps paint was in short supply, or the mechanics haven't had time to finish it. It is striking nonetheless. Ltn. von B\u00fcren was credited with two confirmed victories. Note the cooling holes cut into the upper portion of the cowling. This aircraft is believed to be an Albatros-built Fokker D.VII.", "authorname": "Aviatik IMG", "id": "49465936-7585129228-72157631013058734", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7585129228"}, "flarchive:created": 1387722055}
