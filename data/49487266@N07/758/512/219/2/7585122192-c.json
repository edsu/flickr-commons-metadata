The cantilever wing structure meant it was possible to fly despite a damaged strut. I wonder what hit the wing strut to make it bend? Hopefully, he isn't really going to swing that propeller to start it! The Fokker D.VII didn't need to have the propeller swung to start it. The German Albatros D.III, D.V/Va, and Fokker D.VII fighters could compression start their engines from within the cockpit, something that no allied fighter could do.", "authorname": "Aviatik IMG", "id": "49465936-7585122192-72157631013470370", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7585122192"}, "flarchive:created": 1387722125}
