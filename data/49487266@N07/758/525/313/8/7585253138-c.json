This unique picture is the only known picture of the <b>Fokker V.44</b>. This experimental design was the first design by Reinhold Platz for an shoulder wing passenger airplane seating 5 passengers. According to available data the passengers were seated in an open cabin (!), unfortunately unvisible in this head on view. The reason why this is the only known picture of this design is that the machine was wrecked before the first flight. The pictures originates from the Heinz Nowarra archive.\n\nSource: Peter M.
