The engine and cowl were very similar to those of the 11, hence the 11 and 21 are commonly confused, however this was a larger aircraft than the 11. Originally intended as a long range escort fighter, most of the 21's were used as trainers.", "authorname": "flickrdownldr", "id": "49465936-7586048260-72157630886609922", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7586048260"}, "flarchive:created": 1387666350}
