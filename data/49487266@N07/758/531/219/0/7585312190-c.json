As the factory of Gotha [a division of the Gothaer Waggonfabrik] had no access to water in the neighborhood, they built their own water basin to test the floats. On this factory shot can be seen the first of the three machines delivered to the Ottoman Navy air service, hence the Arabic numeral &quot;1&quot; at the side of the fuselage.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-7585312190-72157634136830178", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7585312190"}, "flarchive:created": 1387673147}
