This particular aircraft differed from the Fokker D.I visually in that instead of a horizontal knife edge at the rear of the fuselage, the fuselage came to a point both vertically and horizontally. A non-standard more angular rudder was installed, but was later replaced on production versions with the standard Fokker 'comma' style rudder. The rear fuselage was also changed from the pointed-rear to a horizontal knife-edged. The same modification was made to the Fokker M.17 prototypes (both single-bay w/ 80 h.p. Oberursel U.O 7-cylinder fitted and the two-bay 100 h.p. Oberursel U.I engined) versions rear fuselages and rudders.", "authorname": "Aviatik IMG", "id": "49465936-7585106630-72157630961863196", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7585106630"}, "flarchive:created": 1387722300}
