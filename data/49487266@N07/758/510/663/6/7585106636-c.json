They flew the Fokker D.II prior to receiving both the Roland D.II, Halberstadt D.II, D.III, and D.V and Albatros D.III aircraft. The fellow closes to the camera resembles Otto Brauneck who was transferred at Manfred von Richthofen's request to go to the Western Front and become a member of Richthofen's elite Jasta 11. He flew a red Albatros D.III w/ a blue propeller spinner on the nose, and a blue elevator at the tail of his machine. He was killed in the early summer of 1917 after a number of successful combats. The prominent nose of this fellow resembles Brauneck's acculine nose.
