It will take quite awhile to view them, and I have questions/requests (I'm sure I 'speak for' many other 'contacts') : \nAre you planning to make this a 'set', making it easier for viewing? \nAre all of these photos from one single collection you have received? Details about about who this collection belonged to? I would hope that they were 'a SD local' ...  (I'm sending you a Flickr email)\n\nThank-you for posting these! I'll tell others about them, including friends in the UK!", "authorname": "Konabish ~ Greg Bishop", "id": "49465936-7585378086-72157630609897192", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/7585378086/#comment72157630610741936", "realname": "SDASM Archives", "path_alias": "sdasmarchives", "author": "49487266@N07", "iconserver": "4070", "datecreate": "1342478222", "_content": "These images were ones in our general aviation collection which we just digitized...it so happens that many of the aircraft are from the UK.
