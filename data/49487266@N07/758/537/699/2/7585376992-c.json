His striking all-yellow racer with it's flame paint job was always a crowd favorite. In 1966 it took third in its first ever cross-country race, followed by a second place in the 1966 Reno Silver race. In 1967, it got a second in the Palm Springs-Cleveland race, followed by a first in the Illinois to Reno race. Mike Carroll died while testing his P-39 racer &quot;Cobra III&quot;, and the Sea Fury was sold to Dr. Sherman Cooper, who renamed it &quot;Miss Merced&quot;. The big yellow racer won the 1970 Reno Silver race, AND the 1970 California 1000 mile endurance race at Mojave. This was followed by <b>winning the United States Cup 1000 mile endurance race in San Diego</b>, and an amazing 3rd place in the Gold Cup race at Reno in 1971.&quot;", "authorname": "Konabish ~ Greg Bishop", "id": "49465936-7585376992-72157630611761826", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7585376992"}, "flarchive:created": 1387672617}
