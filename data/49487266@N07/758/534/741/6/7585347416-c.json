Superficially it resembles the early 1910-1911 Hanriot Libellules, but the steering system differs as the Antoinette double-wheel system seems to be fitted. There is a single pylon holding the wires of the wing, which use wing warping. Landing gear construction is different. The characteristic big tailskid / tailwheel is omitted as the machine probably starts and lands on the long skids. Fitted is a Gnome rotary engine, where Hanriot used an inline water-cooled engine with the radiator standing on the fuselage before the pilot or hanging at the sides of the fuselage. \nIt is not clear who Goldschmidt was, but it could be Robert Goldschmidt who wrote a book in 1911 with the title 'Les a\u00e9romobiles : navigation a\u00e9rienne'. As little is known about this machine it is at least clear that it was not successful and remained a single machine. Given the rarity of this machine it is remarkable that at least four different pictures (inclusive this one) are known of this machine.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-7585347416-72157635948347565", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7585347416"}, "flarchive:created": 1387672878}
