Confirmed by Mr. Steppe-Dweller on J-aircraft Forums. The aircraft behind is either a Kawanishi K8K1 (probable) oder Nippi K8Ni1 (not probable) basic trainer. The latter two are nearly not possible to distinguish. On the left side, there is the Kawanishi E7K1 carrying the Kugisho MXY4 drone.", "authorname": "rotec.holger", "id": "49465936-7585978716-72157633129931871", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7585978716"}, "flarchive:created": 1387667218}
