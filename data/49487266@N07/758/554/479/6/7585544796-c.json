The spelling of the firm is not correct, it is <b>Linke-Hofmann</b> from Breslau (today in Poland with the name Wroc\u0142aw). The Linke-Hofmann firm was a big industrial German firm who specialized in railway stock and heavy locomotives. In 1916 they started a department for aviation [Abteilung Flugzeugbau] which produced their two Riesenflugzeug designs R.I and R.II. Both were very special. The R.II was a 'blown up' normal biplane to extreme dimensions, which had in the nose section 4 coupled engines delivering 1000 hp together and driving a two-bladed propeller of 6,70 / 6,80 meter diameter. The R.II was completed and flown after the war and then probably broken up due to the armistice or the Versailles Peace Treaty terms.\n\n<a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Linke-Hofmann-Werke_\" rel=\"nofollow\">de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Linke-Hofmann-Werke_</a>(1913).jpg", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-7585544796-72157635904504715", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7585544796"}, "flarchive:created": 1387671207}
