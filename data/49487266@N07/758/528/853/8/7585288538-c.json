It is a <b>Friedrichshafen G.IV</b> 1074/18. This machine was one of a batch of 30 license built by Daimler, hence the remark Daim. The whole designation is then Fdh G IV Daim 1074/18. These machines - at least this one - was delivered after the war and the picture gives it in an unfinished state. The G.IV (factory designation FF 61) was a strengthened G.III and was able to carry 10 booms of 100 kg each or the ultimate one bomb of 1000 kg ! \nThe picture also gives some idea of the sparsity of tires at the end of the war in Germany as there are no tires visible.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-7585288538-72157634867571189", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7585288538"}, "flarchive:created": 1387673332}
