The location was inside the harbor of Zeebrugge (Belgium) where Seeflugstation Flandern I was located. The idea was the increase the radius of reconnaissance. In this case the U-boat released the reconnaissance plane after one hour . The machine was able to make a reconnaissance flight over the coast of Kent (England) and return safely. \nWhen the high brass (Admiralstab der Marine) heard of this action it became strictly forbidden to bring out seaplanes to sea in this way. In 1917 experiments were re-started for combined action of U-boats and seaplanes.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-7585284150-72157634887108798", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7585284150"}, "flarchive:created": 1387673370}
