This machine was later modified to a more conventional twin float seaplane and than designated FF 17b. It is great to see this picture fully, that is most of the books which print this picture have left and right pieces cut off. \n\nThe machine in its single float form (FF 17a) was hastily impressed in the German Marine service after the start of the war. It acquired the Marinenummer '64'.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-7585284030-72157634853063312", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7585284030"}, "flarchive:created": 1387673371}
