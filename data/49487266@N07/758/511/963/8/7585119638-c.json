It was then appropriated with several other aircraft by Billy Bishop and Billy Barker for a venture that they were involved in. It was used in a cross country race in the US, flown by Billy Barker, the VC ace who was severely wounded in his Sopwith Snipe in October 1918. Despite a useless left arm, he managed to keep flying. The number 50 on the side was crudely painted on for the aerial race and not a wartime insignia. Other photos existe where a slight black outline was painted around the numerals.", "authorname": "Aviatik IMG", "id": "49465936-7585119638-72157631012528496", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7585119638"}, "flarchive:created": 1387722152}
