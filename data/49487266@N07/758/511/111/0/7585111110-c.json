It flew for many years, lastly wearing the markings of Jasta 11 pilot Willi Gabriel. It later was shown at the Museum of the US Air Force, and then went elsewhere and was, I think, restored. I don't know if this is the aircraft that is at the Museum of the US Airforce now. Did Roger Freeman restore this aircraft? Or is it somewhere else?", "authorname": "Aviatik IMG", "id": "49465936-7585111110-72157631014322678", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7585111110"}, "flarchive:created": 1387722247}
