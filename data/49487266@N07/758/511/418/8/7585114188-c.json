The original Mercedes D.IIIa\u00fc 180-200 h.p. engine has been removed and a Hall-Scott 160 h.p. engine of similar configuration has been fitted. You can see on the left side of the nose two round ports for the Hall-Scott's carburetor air intakes.\n\nAlso, note the wooden bracing fastened to the rear of the fuselage... there were the movie camera mounts to film some of the in the air flying sequences. An S.E.5a flies slightly above and behind the Fokker D.VII.", "authorname": "Aviatik IMG", "id": "49465936-7585114188-72157631012393988", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7585114188"}, "flarchive:created": 1387722206}
