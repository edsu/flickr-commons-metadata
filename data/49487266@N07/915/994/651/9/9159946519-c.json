It was set up by Norwegian born Bernt Balchen by then in the USAAF to augment the British/Norwegian civil flights and  to fly out Norwegian refugees from Sweden and later interned US aircrews who had crash landed in Sweden. C-87 and CB-24Ds (field converted, war-weary B-24s) were used. The first Liberator on the night of 31March/1April 1944 from Leuchars, Scotland arrived at Stockholm-Bromma with no markings and the US Air Attache there, Felix Hardison, had it painted falsely as G-AFYO (as if a British Civil air transport) to keep the Swedish authorities happy .It visited Gothenburg-Torslanda on 2 April so marked. All later Sonnie flights just wore a small NC tail-number. Several thousand passengers were brought out in 550 flights with only one fatal accident. The crews were US military wearing civilian clothes.
