As far as I know Hubert Latham never flew for Bl\u00e9riot but only for the Levavasseur firm, the designer and builder of the Antoinette monoplanes. At right is a Curtiss biplane. Presumably the picture is taken at an early flying week (1909 or 1910 ?) also evidenced by the seats visible at the left side.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-8600435741-72157634586819882", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "8600435741"}}
