The Northrop A-17AS he flew, a single-engined attack aircraft used as a high-speed staff transport, had a reputation for stalling, and only a month before, Col. William McChord had been killed in the crash of one. Westover's aircraft, AC serial 36-349, experienced a high-speed stall and crashed in a crosswind short of the runway at Lockheed Aircraft's air field in Burbank, California, now known as Bob Hope Airport.  No one on the ground was killed, but his crew chief S/Sgt Samuel Hymes also died.\n \nOscar Westover is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Westover Joint Air Reserve Base in Chicopee, Massachusetts, formerly the headquarters of the Eighth Air Force, and now the largest reserve base in the Air Force as home to the 439th Airlift Wing, is named in his honor.\nwiki info", "authorname": "Konabish ~ Greg Bishop", "id": "49465936-8600442617-72157633158321035", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "8600442617"}}
