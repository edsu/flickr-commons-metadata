Just behind the back of woman can be seen the text 'LIFT HERE'. Personnel had to grip the machine there to man handle it. Typical biplane tail, with three rudders. Complex, kite like construction. \n\nA hundred of these Handley Page O/400 bombers were ordered by the US forces (serials 62445 - 62944) by Standard who built them under license, but actually 62445 - 62451 were built.
