The mystery is in the background as they are standing before a twin-engined triplane seaplane, which apparently has two floats fixed to the lowest wing. It seems that the engines power pusher propellers. The pilot of this machine could only sit somewhere in the middle, maybe on top of the lowest wing in a nacelle. But this is speculation as the three men are blocking the view.\n\nI could not find anything remotely resembling this (USA) seaplane and am curious what triplane this could be, probably from the 1920's. Of note is the very large black area above, is this on the original picture ?\n\nPerhaps this picture could be featured in an IDENTIFICATION LOST part of the SDASM Archive?", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-8068629121-72157633199444969", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "8068629121"}}
