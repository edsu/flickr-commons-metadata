In the right, three men perform balance moves on a balance beam next to a wall adorned with a rack from which boxing gloves and squash rackets hang. Beside the beam, two men wearing boxing gloves converse near the pummel horse that two men utilize. In the front center and left of the room, two pairs of men, one pair wearing face guards, fence; two men pull weights attached to the ceiling; and another tests his strength on the parallel bars near men climbing poles. To the rear, other exercisers climb vertical and inclined ropes, hang and climb from exercise ladders, straddle and perform pull-ups on horizontal poles, and dangle upside down from a trapeze. Around the room, spectators including several men and a few women in winter clothing, stand and sit to watch the gym attendees. Roper established the gymnasium circa 1831 which relocated to the 800 block of Walnut Street circa 1833."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2452", "farm": 2, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-05-11 15:09:40", "lastupdate": "1394843458", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1276538317"}, "originalsecret": "e14a03de5d", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "1293", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library-company-of-philadelphia/4700703204/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1395175490}
