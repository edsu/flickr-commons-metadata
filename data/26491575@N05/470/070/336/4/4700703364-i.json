Men, women, and children patrons sit, drink, read, approach, and are served at several tables in front of a stage. In the foreground, men gather near two bars on each side of the saloon. The bar in the right of the image contains a soda fountain. Each is manned by bartenders and is stocked with bottles of liquor. A framed painting, a wall clock, and a large mirror decorate the areas. Several hanging and plotted plants adorn the balconies that are lined with windows. In the background, an actor and two actresses perform on the stage that is flanked by statuary and has a painted backdrop. Also contains a vignette, bordered by filigree, showing the exterior of the hall. View includes crowds of patrons entering the two entrances of the establishment. The Ladners operated the hall  1857-1881."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "732", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-10-06 14:56:48", "lastupdate": "1394843445", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1276538321"}, "originalsecret": "57a56c64be", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4013", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library-company-of-philadelphia/4700703364/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1395175489}
