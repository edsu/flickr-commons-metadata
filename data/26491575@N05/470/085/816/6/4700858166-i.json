Also contains amateur ink-drawn and hand-colored modifications. Retouches show fire hoses in front of the buildings leading to firefighters using a hand-pumper to fight a blaze in the background. Some pedestrian figures also altered with firefigher hats and capes. The church, altered in 1853 to include a front portico, housed the independent congregation of Rev. John Chambers.
