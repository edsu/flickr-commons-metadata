Guests stand on the porch of the twenty-six house hotel  and elegantly dressed men, women and children stroll the grounds in front of the hotel. The house number of each of the twenty-six properties, from 3300-3350, is labeled above the roof line. A Chestnut and Walnut Street streetcar filled with passengers travels east as horse-drawn carriages and coaches travel both in both directions on Walnut Street. The hotel, built on inexpensive land considered undesirable for a permanent hotel, was composed of rows of several houses that were to be later sold or leased as individual dwellings. During the Centennial Exhibition, Hotel  Aubry accommodated about 50,000 people between April and November of 1876."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "727", "farm": 2, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-10-05 16:53:06", "lastupdate": "1394843445", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1275942167"}, "originalsecret": "fe40ca0d0e", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "1278", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library-company-of-philadelphia/4680036532/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1395175505}
