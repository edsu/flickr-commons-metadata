Duval's establishment at the fair. Shows the square and surrounding cityscape from the northwest, including the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul. Trees are visible beside the buildings and line the outside of the square where throngs of people walk the sidewalk and crowd the fair entrances. Horse-drawn vehicles, including carriages and omnibuses travel the streets and park along the grounds. Also shows deer and a turkey grazing in a pasture near the tented rotunda of the Horticultural Department. American flags labeled &quot;U.S.S.C.&quot; adorn all of the buildings. Wrigley designed the majority of the fair buildings except for the central thoroughfare, which was designed by Strickland Kneass. The Great Central or Sanitary Fair of June 1864, displayed art, craft, and historical exhibits to benefit the soldier relief organization, the U.S. Sanitary Commission."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "632", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1850-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1395083674", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1273241419"}, "originalsecret": "0f54c898a6", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4071", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library-company-of-philadelphia/4586154149/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1395175584}
