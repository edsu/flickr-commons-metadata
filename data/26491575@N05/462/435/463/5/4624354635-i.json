A patron opens the entrance door of the storefront as he peers at a large illustrated print on display in an adjacent window. Above the window adorned with the print (illustrated with a man, boy, and dog), a couple is visible in an open double-sided glass door on the second floor. In front of the building, a laborer unloads a horse-drawn dray as a family in winter attire approaches from a nearby corner. Also shows a hoist on the side of the storefront and partial views of neighboring buildings. Mason &amp; Co. occupied the building following its completion in 1851 and tenanted the site until 1919. The building, built 1850-1851, was demolished in 1973."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1024", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-05-11 15:23:44", "lastupdate": "1394843457", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1274379629"}, "originalsecret": "24ae31b229", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3604", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library-company-of-philadelphia/4624354635/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1395175571}
