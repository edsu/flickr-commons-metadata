Statuary and a flag reading &quot;Tower Hall&quot; embellish the building and signs advertise &quot;Quick Sales&quot; and &quot;Small Profits.&quot; A store clerk consults with a patron near one of the four open entryways to the establishment. Clothing adorns the entries and hangs from racks inside the store in which another clerk assists a patron at a display table. Coats and other piles of clothing are visible in the upper floor windows. In front of the store, several crates line the sidewalk. A laborer nails one shut as other workers load a horse-drawn dray. A few of the crates are marked with addresses, including Independence, Mo., Nashville, Tenn., and Augusta, Ga. The three-and-one-half story &quot;Clothing Ware Rooms&quot; stands adjacent to the &quot;Tower Hall.&quot; Signage advertising &quot;Shirts, Collars, Bosoms, Cravats, Wrappers, Hosiery, Handkerchiefs &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and [Edward] &quot;Allman Hatter&quot; and [Robert] &quot;Winchester Grocer&quot; adorns the facade. Patrons exit and enter the doorways of the building in front of which a laborer loads a &quot;Bennet &amp; Co. Tower Hall Clothing Bazaar&quot; wagon. On the sidewalk, near the delivery worker, a woman strolls near two boys in conversation and a man carrying a large package. Partial views of the outerlying, neighboring businesses complete the scene. Signage reading &quot;...T Toland,&quot; (i.e., George Toland, accountant, 180 Market), and &quot;Robert...&quot; adorn the buildings. Also contains a trompe l'oeil wood frame border around the image."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1451", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-05-11 15:23:00", "lastupdate": "1394843457", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1274381137"}, "originalsecret": "5762d7878f", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4064", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library-company-of-philadelphia/4624414793/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1395175567}
