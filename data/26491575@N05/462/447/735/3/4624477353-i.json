Skaters and sledders include men pushing women in chairs with blades, men pushing a sleigh of women passengers, a man pulling a boy on a sled, and a man being pulled by a dog running through a crowd of skaters. In the foreground, a couple stands and watches the activity; a woman peddler, seated on a stool, sells an apple to a boy; and a man has fallen on the ice, near a boy leaning on another boy. In the background, a sleigh ride has been fabricated with several men pushing a large pivoted pole lever to propel a toboggan of women passengers in a circle on an area free from congestion. Watch houses stand near by, with throngs of people surrounding the sheds. Moored ships, steamboats, and sailing vessels line the shore.
