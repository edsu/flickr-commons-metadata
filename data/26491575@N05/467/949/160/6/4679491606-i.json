The central portion of the building looms a few feet over the wings, and is adorned by tall, narrow windows on the second story, with a decorative cornice topped by a statue, bell cupola, and advertising flag. Statues of a lion and two dogs adorn an overhang near the open doorway of the iron foundry inside this central portion, under which a man and woman enter the office and warerooms. Visible inside the factory are several men at a forge, along with laborers working in the left and right wings. A man driving a horse-drawn company carriage emerges from the right wing. Four laborers load a lion statue into a cart on Ridge  Avenue. Several boxes, addressed to &quot;Mobile, Aa.,&quot; &quot;Havana,&quot; &quot;Jackson,&quot; &quot;San Francisco, Ca.,&quot; &quot;Smith &amp; Co., St. Louis,&quot; &quot;Cincinnati, Oo.,&quot; &quot;Jones &amp; Co., New Orleans,&quot; are scattered in the street nearby. Two laborers load (or unload) an iron railing  from a covered cart in the foreground. Men working outdoors with unidentified piles, and additional brick factory buildings are visible in the background. A trompe-l\u2019\u0153il frame border surrounds the image.
