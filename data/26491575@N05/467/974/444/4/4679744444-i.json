Other views depict soldiers using the wash basins adjoining the Cooper Shop Saloon; pro-Union flags and Saloon banners; the Union Saloon\u2019s outside washing and cooking departments including an African American man carrying a pail of food; and interiors of both saloons where male and female volunteers attend to long tables of food and a large simmering vat on a hearth. Contains an eagle clutching large American flags and a pro-Union banner above the scenes. Situated at the transportation hub between the North and the South, the relief organizations provided hospital care, washing, sleeping, and writing facilities to over 1,000,000 military personnel, sailors, refugees, and freedmen during the war. \n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1538", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-05-11 15:13:38", "lastupdate": "1394843457", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1275936629"}, "originalsecret": "c35e6f2154", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4061", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library-company-of-philadelphia/4679744444/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1395175521}
