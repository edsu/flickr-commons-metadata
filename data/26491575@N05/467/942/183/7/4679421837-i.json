Works include a four-story building containing the &quot;office&quot; and adorned with a cupola, a large work yard, and a rear &quot;Foundry.&quot; At the multi-story building, a laborer loads stoves that are lined on the sidewalk into a horse-drawn wagon under the eye of a man at the doorway. On the roof, two other men stand in the cupola that is adorned with a statue of Liberty. In the adjacent work yard, laborers shovel and pick at mounds of coal and bricks, and load and transport hand- and horse-drawn carts on the grounds and up a ramp leading to an opening in the foundry. Near the workers, a group of men, one leaning on a shovel convenes and two boys chase each other over a mound. On the sidewalk, men, women, and children pedestrians stroll past a street  lamp, watch the workers, and converse near a dog sniffing a fire hydrant. In the street, drivers guide horse-drawn carts, a drayman travels, and a pedestrian crosses in the path of an &quot;Abbott &amp; Lawrence Liberty stove  Works&quot; wagon and speeding carriage occupied by a family of three. Street  activity also includes a man on horse back, two dogs in a greeting stance, and two gentlemen engaged in conversation. The firm was reestablished as Abbott &amp; Noble in 1858, and operated until 1915 under various proprietor"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1557", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-05-11 15:04:03", "lastupdate": "1394843457", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1275942505"}, "originalsecret": "16fe0edcc6", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4004", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library-company-of-philadelphia/4679421837/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1395175500}
