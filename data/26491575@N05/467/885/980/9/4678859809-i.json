Oysters Terrapins &amp; Game in Season by Charles Epley&quot; hangs. A male patron descends the stairs to the oyster cellar. A man and boy admire the sepulchral monuments and headstones, many ornamented, which crowd the adjacent fenced, marble yard. Ornamentations include eagles, urns, a female figure at recline, and the inscription &quot;Mother.&quot; In the street, a horse-drawn cart is positioned to receive goods across from a stopped &quot;Girard College &amp; Green Hill Chesnut [sic] and Thirteenth&quot; omnibus. A couple exits the rear of the horse-drawn vehicle that is filled with passengers. A landscape view decorates the cab. In the background, neighboring buildings, one with smoking chimneys, are visible. Hargrave established his business at the address in 1844 and operated from the location until the later 1860s.
