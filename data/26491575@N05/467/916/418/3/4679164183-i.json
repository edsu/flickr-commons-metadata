Upper panel shows four men, two women and three boys in a furnished parlor. All of the men are attired in long jackets, vests, cravats and patterned pants. Two hold or wear hats, and two hold canes. To the left, two men stand and converse with two women. The seated lady holds a fan and wears an evening dress, with a low, straight neckline. Her hair is styled in ringlets, and a flower rests behind her ear. The other woman adorns outerwear styled with a high-necked, tight-waisted dress, shawl and plumed bonnet. To the right, two men stand with three boys, who all wear flat caps. The boy on the left is dressed in an Eton suit, while the other two younger boys wear longer tunic suits. The parlor is furnished with carpet and ornate furniture, vases and landscape paintings. The bottom panel shows an outdoor, hunting scene centered around a man and woman mounted on horses. The scene includes five men and one woman, with three people on each side of the couple. The men wear long jackets, patterned pants, waistcoats, cravats and hats, and the women are attired in riding habits. The lady riding the horse wears a top hat adorned with a veil. A dog runs beside the trotting horses in the foreground and sailing vessels are visible on the sea in the background (right).
