[A series of caricatures.] - caption: ''The Ministers and their cronies off to Botany Bay, and the Dorcester men returning'. Politicians in tears on a boat, going away from the shore; free Dorchester Unionists on another boat, getting closer to the shore. \nAt the bow is a flag reading 'FOR BOTANY BAY'. The two oarsmen guide the boat towards a ship from which is returning another boat, containing two oarsmen and the six Tolpuddle Martyrs. Among the politicians are Lord Chancellor Brougham, with two money-bags marked 'PENNY' and 'MAGAZINE', and holding a rolled-up paper reading 'CHEAP LAW'. Brougham is being comforted by Lord Melbourne. The Chancellor of the Exchequer Viscount Althorp, has a sack bearing the word 'BUDGET'. The Duke of Wellington declaims 'Never mind M-lb-n, we no doubt can get places among the Cannibals at Bottomhouse Bay. An Irishman and a Scotsman look on, while John Bull addresses the politicians.'"}, "tagspace": "XMP-dc", "tagspaceid": 0, "tag": "Title", "label": "Title"}], "farm": 4, "server": "3785", "secret": "1d960c886b", "camera": "", "id": "12459418964"}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1394315768}
