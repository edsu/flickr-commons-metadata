The family chose tables, chairs, desks and beds from the Gispen catalogues issued in 1933 and 1934.\n\n\nThe Sonneveld House was built in the early 1930\u2019s, it\u2019s a perfect example of the \u2018Nieuwe Bouwen\u2019 functionalist style, designed by architecture firm Brinkman and Van der Vlugt. Much of its furniture was designed by W.H. Gispen.  It\u2019s now a House Museum preserved by The New Institute and open for the public. The Sonneveld family's personal archive and the architects business archive contain great quantities of useful information about everyday life in the house and how it was designed and furnished.\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1536", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2013-10-11 13:05:39", "lastupdate": "1387572195", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1382270543"}, "originalsecret": "8fba3c2770", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3808", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nai_collection/10209029853/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387636056}
