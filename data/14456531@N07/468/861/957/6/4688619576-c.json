Mounted cavalry saw  great deal of action in the last 100 days of WW1 when the allies were pursuing the retreating Germans. \nThe British heavy tanks were designed to crush wire and silence MGs and thus are probably best compared to siege weapons, though they occasionally fulfilled the shock role of heavy cavalry on the open battlefields in the later half of the 100 days. Some consideration was given to using tanks in the traditional exploitation role of light cavalry, thus the British built the Whippet and the French the Renault FT17. The light cavalry's scouting role had been filled by the RFC / RAF. \nTank crews did not apparently regard themselves as cavalrymen, first world war tank units were designated Companies not Squadrons (I don't know if this is still the case in the RTR). Cavalry terms were presumably only adopted by British tank crews when the British cavalry was (reluctantly) mechanized in the 1930's. Tank crews came from a variety of units, some may have been cavalrymen but they were apparently not overrepresented.", "authorname": "munkeezulu", "id": "14435201-4688619576-72157629624828074", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4688619576"}}
