The Vickers machine guns were exchanged for the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun which was the standard machine gun of the British tank unit. The 17th Battalion arrived in France in April 1918. Its first operations were in support of the French Army in June. It returned to the British Army in August and was very successful at the Battle of Amiens. The Austins were towed in pairs by tanks across the battlefield. Once they reached better ground on the other side of the lines, they ranged freely. A German Corps headquarters 10 miles back was captured and German reserves, artillery and supply lines were shot up. The 17th was the first British unit to cross the Rhine in 1918.\n\nAfter the war, the bodies were reused on Peerless lorry chassis. Some of these were still in service at the start of the Second World War.\n\nSome cars were sent to the Caspian Sea region. Austins were also used by the British in the Anglo-Irish War.&quot;", "authorname": "Indread Coal", "id": "14435201-4699272529-72157631717759939", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "4699272529"}}
