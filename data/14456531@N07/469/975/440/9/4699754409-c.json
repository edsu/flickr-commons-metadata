Actually it consisted no of placing the pegs but of picking them up with a spear-point. Wikipedia says, &quot;The specific game of tent pegging has a mounted horseman riding at a gallop and using a sword or a lance to pierce, pick up, and carry away a small ground target (a symbolic tent peg) or a series of small ground targets.&quot;\n\nThe picture certainly fills in my mental image of this challenging sport!
