She was Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Mary and her lifelong friend whose  own contribution to the Red Cross was widely acknowledged.  For that dedication she was created Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire.  Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth also honored her at a later time.  The lady in the picture is walking with Queen Mary, though not exactly at her side, as that is the duty of the uniformed officers on this occasion.", "authorname": "Myrtle26", "id": "14435201-4699929477-72157629086545884", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "4699929477"}}
