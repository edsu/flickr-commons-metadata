His description of a british bombardment, both prior, when the horses were moving at night along the line in silvery moonlight { a bad thing in war, as it enables things to be seen} and during the attack, and it's awful aftermath. \nMaybe the two pages of writing , so powerfully written in the original translation, is what prompted the novel and play ''War Horse''. My son's great Grandad was in the RHA 1914-19 and the horses were  as well looked after as they could be in those harrowing conditions.", "authorname": "oakleaf25", "id": "14435201-4699970253-72157627433367819", "iconfarm": 7}], "photo_id": "4699970253"}}
