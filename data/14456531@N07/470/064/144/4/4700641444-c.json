As QuarterMaster General of the British Army during First World War he was descibed as &quot;The best QuarterMaster since Moses&quot;. His honours and decorations include CB, KCB, GCB and GCMG.  On the other hand he had human weaknesses. Cowans was &quot; General X &quot; in the lurid legal case of Dennistoun v Dennistoun, from 1925. He was cited by Dororthy Dennistoun the defendant in that case as having given preferment to her husband, Lt Colonel Ian Onslow Dennistoun during his career in the British Army. Dorothy also claimed she became Cowans' mistress in exchange for the General advancing Ian Dennistoun's army career. \n\nJohn Cowans, the man behind the General  and his  citation in the Dennistoun case is substantially described in &quot;Tales From The Cabbage Patch&quot;  - a forthcoming biography of Almina, Countess of Carnarvon, 1876-1969 by William Cross, FSA Scot. \n\nOn the death of Almina's first husband, George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, of King Tut fame, she married the above mentioned Lt Colonel Ian Onslow Dennistoun.\n\nLady Cowans, aka Eva Mary Coulson, the widow of General Cowans survived until 1934.\n\nFor further information please contact\n\nwilliecross@aol.com", "authorname": "Almina, Countess of Carnarvon", "id": "14435201-4700641444-72157624499464732", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4700641444"}}
