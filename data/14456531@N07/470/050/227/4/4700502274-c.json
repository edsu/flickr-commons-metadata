The heliograph was used to signal by Morse code using flashes of reflected sunlight created by tilting the mirror intermittently. This one is set up in the &quot;duplex&quot; (twin mirror) arrangement.   The duplex configuration was used when the sun was on the opposite side of the signaller from the target. The leather carrying case dangling below the tripod by the shoulder strap was use to carry the parts atop the tripod for travel, and the tripod itself was slung over the shoulder by the strap attached to the left leg of the tripod, with the cylindrical cap at the end of the sling holding the legs of the tripod together. The disc dangling just above the case is a protective cap (with female threads) that protected the male threads atop the tripod.  As noted at left, the heliograph saw little use during the trench warfare on the Western front in WWI, but rather more so in the mobile warfare towards the end. Another photograph of heliographs in use on the western front is this one at the Imperial War Museum: <a href=\"http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205072698\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205072698</a> .For more information on heliographs, see the Wikipedia article on heliographs and its references.", "authorname": "signal mirror", "id": "14435201-4700502274-72157630124817434", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlscotland/4700502274/#comment72157632328162185", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "39411748@N06", "iconserver": "2543", "datecreate": "1356371547", "_content": "British troops operating from Nordia Hotel building overlooking Jaffa Road and Barclays Bank, showing heliograph operator signaling to troops on Tower of David, Jerusalem, Palestine - circa 1938\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/39411748@N06/8303731400/\" title=\"British troops operating from Nordia Hotel building overlooking Jaffa Road and Barclays Bank, showing heliograph operator signaling to troops on Tower of David, Jerusalem, Palestine - circa 1938 by DesertBlooms, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8216/8303731400_7c317bed0f.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"323\" alt=\"British troops operating from Nordia Hotel building overlooking Jaffa Road and Barclays Bank, showing heliograph operator signaling to troops on Tower of David, Jerusalem, Palestine - circa 1938\" /></a>", "authorname": "DesertBlooms", "id": "14435201-4700502274-72157632328162185", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4700502274"}}
