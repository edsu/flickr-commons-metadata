III naval gun used on a static siege mount to shell Nieuport in Belgium. 14 of them were salvaged from the pre-dreadnaught battleship Swiftsure when it was decommissioned in 1917, with some going to coastal defense in Britain and a few for siege work in Belgium along the coast there. However, I must confess that this gun looks larger than 7.5 inch, perhaps a 9.2 inch or even a 12 inch spare barrel for a rail road gun.", "authorname": "SASH155", "id": "14435201-3012797250-72157622625945591", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlscotland/3012797250/#comment72157625436595973", "realname": "Harry", "path_alias": "flipdrivel", "author": "8492043@N07", "iconserver": "1318", "datecreate": "1291898921", "_content": "Not so much a tractor, something that hardly existed at the time, more a steam-powered traction engine.", "authorname": "flipdrivel", "id": "14435201-3012797250-72157625436595973", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlscotland/3012797250/#comment72157625829090874", "realname": "", "path_alias": "phrawggmak", "author": "84712921@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1295107843", "_content": "that gun isn't big enough. they should go back to base and try harder.", "authorname": "phrawggmak", "id": "14435201-3012797250-72157625829090874", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3012797250"}}
