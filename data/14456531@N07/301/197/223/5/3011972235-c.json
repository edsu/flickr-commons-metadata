He was in the royal warwickshire regiment I believe it was the 16th battalion. He told me that all the men in the picture were killed, he was the only one who survived. His brother was in the royal artillary, and the both went through the war, with my grandfather joining at fourteen", "authorname": "colinjerromes@btconnect.com", "id": "14435201-3011972235-72157612167047360", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlscotland/3011972235/#comment72157622733460078", "realname": "Kev Arnold", "path_alias": null, "author": "30273252@N02", "iconserver": "7336", "datecreate": "1257358423", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1246482@N22/\">British Army</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Steelback", "id": "14435201-3011972235-72157622733460078", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlscotland/3011972235/#comment72157632544987540", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "37603130@N07", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1358419907", "_content": "Fascinating story Colin!", "authorname": "-byline-", "id": "14435201-3011972235-72157632544987540", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3011972235"}}
