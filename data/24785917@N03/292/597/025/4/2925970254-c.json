There seems to have been a new line of road in about 1900 avoiding this &quot;famous zigzag&quot; (as it was known in contemporary newspapers), and not quite so steep - probably the track marked as &quot;Burragorang Rd&quot; on this Google MapsSatelliteImage - <a href=\"https://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=Burragorang+Road,+Nattai,+New+South+Wales&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=-34.072902,150.439763&amp;spn=0.017987,0.042272&amp;sll=-34.070441,150.536514&amp;sspn=0.14703,0.338173&amp;oq=Burragorang+Road,+Nattai,+New+South+Wales&amp;t=w&amp;hnear=Burragorang+Rd,+Nattai+New+South+Wales+2570&amp;z=15\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com.au/maps?q=Burragorang+Road,+Nattai,+New+S...</a> .   \nAs [http://www.flickr.com/photos/47572660@N08] says above, the zigzag appears to be beneath the lookout.  There seems to be a bit  of a track discernible in the trees,  though probably overgrown or washed away;  hence few recent references to the stunning view.\n\nA Trove search produces several interesting newspaper articles ca.1900 talking about the zigzag.   <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/result?q=burragorang+road+zigzag\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/result?q=burragorang+road+zigzag</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-2925970254-72157631688719084", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2925970254/#comment72157631831432183", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1350945312", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/47572660@N08] [http://www.flickr.com/photos/highranger] There is a better resolution satellite photo (dated Feb 2010) at <a href=\"http://www.nearmap.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nearmap.com/</a> .
