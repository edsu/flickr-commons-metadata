And great spotting of the Blue Peter flag.\n\nWhat do you think the substantial building on the horizon at the left of the Blue Peter is?  I'm thinking it may be the rear of Sydney Hospital, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe date you have identified on  which both ships were in the bay, Monday 19 September 1892 is a very good possibility as the date of this photograph.  However it cannot yet be taken as definitive because of the problems with Optical Character Recognition with the text of the old newspapers in the National Library of Australia's Trove database.\n\nYou search mainly works on the OCR derived text which is displayed in the left hand side window at the link you have given.  As you would have also noticed, much in that text (&quot;Electronically Translated Text&quot;) box is scrambled googledegook.\n\nIf in another shipping notice in the Sydney Morning Herald or another newspaper the two ships are also noted as being in the bay at the same time, but one of the names is not correctly &quot;electronically translated&quot; then it would not have shown up in your search.\n\nSo we cannot yet say that is the date.  But it may be.\n\nMany wonderfully dedicated people are working online to correct the text, so the searches are becoming more accurate and complete every day:\n\n<a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/hallOfFame\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/hallOfFame</a>\n\nI've also written a little about this problem with the Optical Character Recognition on my blog here:\n\n<a href=\"http://lifeasdaddy.typepad.com/lifeasdaddy/2009/10/should-the-national-library-of-australia-throw-their-lot-in-with-google-news-archives.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">lifeasdaddy.typepad.com/lifeasdaddy/2009/10/should-the-na...</a>\n\nOn another note, Mariposa was also used later for another ship which plied the trade to Australia, e.g. here:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/imageservices/index.php/2009/08/on-board-the-ss-mariposa/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.powerhousemuseum.com/imageservices/index.php/2009/08/...</a>\n\nand here:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/2697969498/\">www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/2697969498/</a>", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "24762863-3388853344-72157623733198714", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3388853344/#comment72157623739770940", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1270028260", "_content": "BobMeade, thanks for taking the time to explain the problems with OCR technology - I have taken note to be cautious, but what a terrific and easy tool for research it will be when reliable.\n\nIt took me a while to find out, but the &quot;substantial building on the horizon&quot; (see note) is the then recently completed (1891) Australian Club on the SW corner of Bent and Macquarie Streets.
