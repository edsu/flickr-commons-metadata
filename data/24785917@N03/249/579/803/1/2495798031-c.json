There is one gun on the foredeck and traces of a gun embrasure or casemate on the forward hull below the foc's'le.\n\nThese points suggest this is either HMS Whiting or HMS Wizard. The names were changed in 1890 to Boomerang and Karakatta. Both vessels were launched in 1889 and survived until sold out of service in 1905. The Victorian livery again suggests pre 1902/1903.\n\nThe deck gun would be a 4.7-inch, one of two carried by these ships plus there were 5 x 14-inch torpedo tubes and four x 3-pounders. A 3-pounder would be mounted in the foc's'l casemate or embrasure.\n\nCompare with:  <a href=\"http://www.library.uq.edu.au/fryer/hume/hume774.jpg\">www.library.uq.edu.au/fryer/hume/hume774.jpg</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.library.uq.edu.au/fryer/hume/hume494.jpg\">www.library.uq.edu.au/fryer/hume/hume494.jpg</a>\n\nPlease add to:  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/navalhistory/\">Naval History</a>", "authorname": "Whipper_snapper", "id": "24762863-2495798031-72157617237622590", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2495798031/#comment72157627769945589", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1318629393", "_content": "Same dock c.1900 -\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5889052507/]", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-2495798031-72157627769945589", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2495798031/#comment72157630788406348", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1343483140", "_content": "<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page5254182\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-page5254182</a> - this 1897 T&amp;CJ pic might be useful for dating pics of this dock...it shows the building beside the dock and also the crane (which I gather was on wheels)", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "24762863-2495798031-72157630788406348", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2495798031/#comment72157634443571390", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79583367@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1372754137", "_content": "I've often wondered what was that large building on the horizon, presumably on Victoria Road Drummoyne.", "authorname": "1kevin2", "id": "24762863-2495798031-72157634443571390", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2495798031"}}
