Henry Kendall (using the nom 'A Mopoke') wrote a satirical poem titled 'Ode to the Stick Supplanted by Cook's Statue', which appeared in the Sydney newspaper the Freeman's Journal about a month after the Cook statue was unveiled (FJ 29/3/1879, p.20). If you didn't know the background you might be left wondering what Kendall was on about.  However, if you scratch around you discover that one of the shakers and movers on the Cook Statue Committee was the Sydney lawyer and politician Robert Burdett Smith (1837-1895), who was at the time the (absentee) Member for the electorate of Hastings, which included the township of Camden Haven, where Kendall then lived. These were the days when members didn't actually have to live in their electorate. Being a self-promoting, careerist politician and a pork-barreller, Smith had long since incurred Kendall's wrath, and during the later 1870s and early 1880s he was frequently pilloried by Kendall in the witty satirical pieces which Kendall wrote for the Australian Town and Country Journal and the Sydney Mail. For further info refer to Michael Ackland's excellent bio of Kendall.", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "24762863-2582652904-72157628603545117", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2582652904/#comment72157628610028029", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1325106779", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979177@N02] That all happened in my backyard;  I am in Port Macquarie.
