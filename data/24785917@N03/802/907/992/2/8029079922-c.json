The pic was taken at Alex Davis' farm 'Woodlands', located in the Gilmore Valley, near Tumut, in southern NSW. 'Woodlands' was placed second in the 'Slopes and Plains' division of the competition ; <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CzlVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DZUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6906,8249247\" rel=\"nofollow\">news.google.com/newspapers?id=CzlVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DZUDA...</a>\n\nThe original negative appears to have been damaged early on in its life...if you zoom in on the original non post-card version, it looks as if someone might have forgotten to hold the plate by the edges. In this post-card version, the hill to the rhs has been dodged, not clear-felled (!). They didn't have Lightroom back in those days! \n\nIt would be fantastic if someone with a large format camera could take a pic from this same location...then we'd have a contemporary version to place beside the stunningly beautiful 105 year old Kerry &amp; Co original...as is evident, this post-card version is a slightly enlarged and cropped reproduction, and it doesn't have the clarity, dynamic range or detail of the original. To see the pic at its best, zoom in on the original non post-card version at the PHM - <a href=\"http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=30166\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=30166</a>\n\n\nThe PHM Tyrrell Collection includes several other pics of 'Woodlands' which were taken at this same time:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/4903867970/\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/4903867970/</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/4903861352/\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/4903861352/</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=30165&amp;search=wheat&amp;images=&amp;c=&amp;s=\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=30165&amp;a...</a>", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "24762863-8029079922-72157631648021449", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/8029079922/#comment72157632493995197", "realname": "Yannich Rival", "path_alias": null, "author": "89161480@N07", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1357935647", "_content": "That is it a shot !
