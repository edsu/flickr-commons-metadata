The first photo from my home town/ish! The amazing thing is that without the men and their clothes this could very easily be mistaken for a photo taken within the past 20 years, I've spent many hours playing in and around old sheds like this one!\n\nThanks to the Powerhouse for bringing back some wonderful memories.. I can still smell the oils soaked into the timber, feel the grass seeds scratching through my socks and taste the squashed sandwiches Dad packed for us :)", "authorname": "alyssa.maree", "id": "24762863-2801051187-72157624321945031", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "2801051187"}}
