The narrow, squat, sandstone structure was locally known as the &quot;Guard-house&quot;. Along with a large pine tree known as the &quot;Whipping Tree&quot;, the local storytellers had convicts being regularly cruelly flogged and incarcerated in the &quot;Guard House&quot;.\n\nVarious theories exist as to just what use the &quot;Guard House&quot; was originally intended, but it is unlikely to have ever been used to imprison convicts. More likely, it was intended as a &quot;Garden House&quot; for Georgina Hely.\n\nAnother theory was that the building was intended as a Chapel, at which the Hely family and estate workers could worship. The church-like windows and the look of the building when you imagine a steeple on it, makes this a distinct possibility. Unfortunately we will probably never know the original purpose of this building! it was demolished in 1918 by John W. Campbell. &quot;\n\nFull story and another picture by Kerry a few feet to the right dated 1908 here - <a href=\"http://www.gosford.nsw.gov.au/library/local_history/Suburbs/documents/wyoming.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.gosford.nsw.gov.au/library/local_history/Suburbs/docu...</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-3927692443-72157622487259208", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3927692443/#comment72157622449927979", "realname": "Gary Crockett", "path_alias": "garyjenny", "author": "10244019@N02", "iconserver": "3725", "datecreate": "1255407335", "_content": "Nice work beachcomber - Frederick Hely was Sydney's Principal Superintendent of Convicts throughout the 1820s and early 1830s who owned land in the Brisbane Waters area, which might explain the romantic allusion to the old convict days...see <a href=\"http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010491b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010491b.htm</a>", "authorname": "garycrockett", "id": "24762863-3927692443-72157622449927979", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3927692443/#comment72157634091568241", "realname": "", "path_alias": "vercettisworld", "author": "14343849@N05", "iconserver": "8323", "datecreate": "1371082808", "_content": "Fascinating!
