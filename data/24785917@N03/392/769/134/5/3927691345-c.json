I\nSir,-My knowledge of Clovelly Beach goes back to 1884, when, as a child of seven, I learnt to swim there, and even then it was at week-ends frequented by crowds of swimmers.  As the years went by this popularity ceased and it was for many years prior to 1904 the only Sydney beach where open sea bathing was freely indulged in, and though at rare intervals a policeman from Randwick would visit the beach, the authorities very seldom enforced the law against\nbathing. Though Little Coogee is sheltered from the north and the surf does not beat there to\nthe extent it does on the other beaches, it is surf bathing nevertheless and Little Coogee can well claim the honour of being the first Sydney beach where surf bathing as we know\nit to-day started.\nYours etc\nR H REID\nTamworth Sept 12 [1939]\n</blockquote>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-3927691345-72157628225121949", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3927691345/#comment72157629149424517", "realname": "Andrey Timofeev", "path_alias": "timodrey", "author": "60866881@N08", "iconserver": "3816", "datecreate": "1328224706", "_content": "Stunning picture.", "authorname": "Andrey Timofeev", "id": "24762863-3927691345-72157629149424517", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3927691345"}}
