It's a gong! Gong's were all the rage in the 1920s and were almost un heard of in Jazz/dance bands by the mid 1930s. \n\nFor all the modern music minded, in the 1920s and 30s, music was much different. It was playful, syncopated and intricate. Drummers of this era were extremely talented (I'd like to see some of today's drummers go against some of the guys of early Jazz) and one kit would differ from the next. However there were many similar things that could be found in a typical 1920s drum kit such as coconuts, cowbells, a gong, suspended symbols from thick wire mounts, chimes and a small vibraphone off to the side. \n\nWatching some of the early Vitaphone one reel shorts of 1929 to the early 30s one can really get a better understanding of early jazz music. :-)\n\nI would have to say, this is a pretty elaborate kit, I've never seen such a bridge over the base drum such as this, and I'm sure that &quot;Nerd&quot; behind there was the life beat of the band. I'm going to see if I can dig up some recordings of this band, if they made any\u2026 what a different world it was back then\u2026 in some ways, a better one.", "authorname": "worldsfair39", "id": "24762863-3928478720-72157627555520065", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3928478720/#comment72157627636033953", "realname": "", "path_alias": "blackforestrider", "author": "61834020@N00", "iconserver": "107", "datecreate": "1317069910", "_content": "Maybe he's a lefty.....ala Ian Paice.", "authorname": "David Leonty", "id": "24762863-3928478720-72157627636033953", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3928478720/#comment72157628004309330", "realname": "", "path_alias": "charlespricephotography", "author": "48739565@N05", "iconserver": "4013", "datecreate": "1319904908", "_content": "Drum kit on wheels....nice", "authorname": "CharlesPricePhotography", "id": "24762863-3928478720-72157628004309330", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3928478720/#comment72157628027566005", "realname": "", "path_alias": "hayleyorton", "author": "65465776@N06", "iconserver": "8275", "datecreate": "1321556045", "_content": "nice :)", "authorname": "Hayley*-*", "id": "24762863-3928478720-72157628027566005", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3928478720/#comment72157628647408077", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "64752931@N08", "iconserver": "2835", "datecreate": "1325323928", "_content": "<b>This is an amazing Natural picture thanx for sharing it with us in\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1157334@N21/pool/\"> \u273f Rose is a part of nature, Nature is a part of me \u273f\n<img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4136/4905361107_280b54d7b7_z.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"106\" alt=\"Rose is a part of nature\" /></a></b>\n(post 1 ~ aWARD 3)\n<b>For 3 Awards from this group</b> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1157334@N21/discuss/72157622021590155/\"> Post Here</a>\n<b>For 5+ Awards from this group</b> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1157334@N21/discuss/72157622021598519/\"> Post Here</a>\n\n\n\n\nIt will look like this:\n\nThis is an amazing Natural picture thanx for sharing it with us in\n\u273f Rose is a part of nature, Nature is a part of me \u273f\nRose is a part of Nature, Nature is a part of me\n(post 1 ~ aWARD 3)\nFor 3 Awards from this group Post Here\nFor 5+ Awards from this group Post Here\n\n\n\nfree counters\n\n\nUlteriori informazioni\n\nQuesto gruppo \u00e8 pubblico Questo \u00e8 un gruppo pubblico.\n\n    Visualizza le regole del gruppo.\n    I membri possono inserire 1 elemento nel pool al giorno.\n    Tipologia di formati accettati:\n        Foto\n    Tipologia di contenuti accettati:\n        Foto\n        Schermate\n        Illustrazioni/elementi grafici\n    Livelli di sicurezza accettati:\n        Sicura\n\n    Uscir", "authorname": "capitan flickr", "id": "24762863-3928478720-72157628647408077", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3928478720/#comment72157628671549651", "realname": "", "path_alias": "crexcrex", "author": "59302818@N00", "iconserver": "2877", "datecreate": "1325463974", "_content": "I started playing drums with my uncles band at age 15 in 1951 and  with the exception of the 'Gong' and the 'Wheels' this was the kind of drumkit that I played.  This was in the rural Ireland of the forties and fifties when electricty had still not reached many parts of the countryside. Most of the country halls we played in had no electricity and the hall was lit by \n 'Tilley Lamps'.  I even remember that Rinso Flakes or Shredded candle wax was often spread on the dance floor instead of French Chalk.  The sound system usually consisted of one mic and two small speakers for the crooner.  The amp was operated by the battery from the car that conveyed the band to the gig. All the gear on top of the bass drum was known as 'The Traps' and the four spherical blocks were known as Skulls.  There was also a 'Wood Block with slit in each side that was known as a 'Clog Box'  aka a 'Temple Block'  \nThe cymbals operated by the foot were known as a 'Low Hat'  Most of the drummers in those days started life in marching bands, hence the stance of this particular drummer.  although in this case he also looks like a left handed drummer aka Cack Handed.  As a naive young lad in short trousers I asked the band leader 'When do I hit the Skullls' and he told me in no uncertain terms 'Beat the Shite out ot them when you hear the band playing a tune about a horse&quot; lol.", "authorname": "corncrake68", "id": "24762863-3928478720-72157628671549651", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3928478720/#comment72157628672603083", "realname": "Samm Bennett", "path_alias": "flapjax_at_midnite", "author": "24184828@N08", "iconserver": "5522", "datecreate": "1325468976", "_content": "corncrake, that's all really interesting, thanks so much for your comment!

I too graduated from a marching (side) drum to a kit, and every kit I ever played had the high-hat pedal under the left foot and the bass pedal under the right.
