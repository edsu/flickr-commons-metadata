Indeed it is far superior to contemporary examples. However his annex building on the Pitt Street end of Australia Square makes it clear he could compromise good design for commercial imperatives. It's hideous and adds nothing to anything except developer floor space. The courtyard and the main building would have sat better without it. Later at the MLC Centre he took some of those undesirable aspects a few steps further.", "authorname": "GrenadierGuardsDmr", "id": "24762863-2533263654-72157627622152825", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2533263654"}}
