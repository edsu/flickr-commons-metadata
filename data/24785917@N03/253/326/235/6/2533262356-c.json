'Art', which occupies the upper niche, was the last statue added, on 13/1/1888. 'Science', which occupies the middle niche, was added on 27/10/1883. So this pic was taken some time between those dates.\n\nSee my comments on the Colonial Secretary's Office statues at - <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/3793507471/\">www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/3793507471/</a>\n\nThe statue of T.S.
