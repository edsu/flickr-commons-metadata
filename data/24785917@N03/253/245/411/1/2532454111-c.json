The row of six terrace houses to the left of the picture are now craft shops. They are in Collins Street, which is the main road from points north. The railway line can be seen on the left of the picture, above the terraces. The church near the railway line is the Baptist Church. The row of Norfolk Island pines in the mid-distance are between Manning Street and Kiama surf beach. Another very detailed image!", "authorname": "Wardie44B", "id": "24762863-2532454111-72157623412803091", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2532454111"}}
