When you know there is a steep hill on the right with a road cut through the rock (Argyle Cut) along the bottom of the picture, it begins to make sense.\n\nThe area has changed considerably since then.  Slum clearance after the bubonic plague in 1900, and the approach roads for the Sydney Harbour Bridge flattened the right side of the street.  The corner house (with penthouse) at centre is no longer there, but the next house is - a  top floor window is now the front door, due to s street level rise of about two metres (to raise the bridge?).
