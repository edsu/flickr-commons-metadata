If you look at photograph by Kerry in the Tyrrell collection of the front of the fountain you can see it was taken from that bridge.\n\nHere is the other view on Flickr:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2362680091/\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2362680091/</a>\n\nThrough at the Persistent URL for that image, we can see that in part the curator's note says:\n\n&quot;... The image depicts The Venus fountain in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. The image appears to have been taken from a bridge in the gardens and part of the bridge is depicted in the foreground of the image. The Venus fountain is depicted in the centre of the image. It features a female figure with cupid and dolphins at her feet. The Venus fountain is located in the Main Pond in the Lower Garden of the Royal Botanic Gardens. The fountain and pond are the focal points of the image. The background of the image depicts the vegetation in the gardens. The caption, studio mark and studio number are inscribed on the reverse of the negative.\n\nThe Venus fountain was originally made of zinc alloy with lead intrusions and mounted on a rock base. It features a female figure representing Venus with cupids and dolphins at her feet. Double fountain sprays are located with each dolphin and shell fountains with each cupid. The base of the fountain was originally surrounded by weathered rocks and large clam shells as depicted in this image. These were later replaced by a sculptured crocodile. The base of the fountain is currently unadorned. The statue was recast in bronze in 1990.\n\n61/71 Tyrrell Inventory Number, 22 Kerry Studio Number&quot;\n\n[ ref. 85/1284-14 Glass negative, full plate, 'The Lake, Botanical Gardens', Kerry and Co, Sydney, Australia, c. 1884-1917 \n<a href=\"http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=27979\">www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=27979</a> ]", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "24762863-3230390000-72157613065969440", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3230390000/#comment72157616975327260", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1240053819", "_content": "Girolamo Nerli (one of Heidelberg artists) - \n&quot;Botanic Gardens, Sydney&quot; 1886 (AGNSW)\n<a href=\"http://collection.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/results.do?db=object&amp;sort=user_sym_34&amp;id=138569&amp;keyword-0=NLETTER&amp;browse=australian/paintings/browse&amp;images=true&amp;bool-0=AND&amp;field-0=user_sym_39&amp;bool-1=AND&amp;field-1=user_sym_41&amp;dept=australian/paintings&amp;view=detail&amp;value-1=Australian+Art/Paintings\" rel=\"nofollow\">collection.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/results.do?db...</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-3230390000-72157616975327260", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3230390000/#comment72157623040077630", "realname": "Rebekka Erika Platt", "path_alias": "phooey_erika", "author": "45509721@N07", "iconserver": "8449", "datecreate": "1261359333", "_content": "i love this. its always interesting how entertaining parks were the past", "authorname": "phooey the screen name Erika is already taken", "id": "24762863-3230390000-72157623040077630", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3230390000/#comment72157625338713412", "realname": "Fl\u00e1vio", "path_alias": null, "author": "53001232@N06", "iconserver": "4114", "datecreate": "1289217908", "_content": "Interesting!!", "authorname": "Flav2011", "id": "24762863-3230390000-72157625338713412", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3230390000/#comment72157625239987719", "realname": "Debbie Decker", "path_alias": "ghostmagnet", "author": "13692934@N00", "iconserver": "2166", "datecreate": "1289488624", "_content": "Your photos are very cool!", "authorname": "Ghostfinder-Deb", "id": "24762863-3230390000-72157625239987719", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3230390000"}}
