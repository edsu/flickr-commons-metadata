The images are on both whole and half plate negatives and many of the larger images are of a high quality.\n\nThe subjects covered by the images relate strongly to a number of the Museum's collecting fields. Leisure and the performing arts are represented by a group of unusual boxing and fencing photographs, as well as sailing and portrait photos. One of these is a rare composite negative intended for producing Christmas greeting cards.\n\nThe numerous images of locations and buildings around Sydney and New South Wales depict the social and economic enterprise of the period. While some are of more commonly photographed subjects, such as the Botanical Gardens and Sydney Town Hall, others are of subjects such as logging and the foundations for the Queen Victoria Building.\n\nThere is another less formal set of negatives included in this collection that show community history in regional New South Wales. At some time around 1918 the photographer either lived in, or visited, Walcha and Crookwell where they took photographs of the shops and streets of these rural towns. They also captured local events and activities such as wood chopping at the Crookwell Spring Show, rare images of Peace Day celebrations 1918, snow falling in 1912 and children dressed as birds.\n\nThe Museum has a significant collection of glass plates, such as those held in the Tyrrell and Clyde Engineering collections. This group of negatives complements and strengthens the Museum's holdings of this particular photographic resource.\nDescription\nGlass plate negative (1 of 193), newly built large house, Federation style, glass, photographer unknown, Australia, c. 1900\n\nGlass plate negative, landscape view, black and white, view of a large, newly built house, with attic rooms, tower and widow's walk. Wide verandas on two sides, French doors. Narrow winding road leads up to the front door. The garden is bare.\nProduction Notes include information about the design, manufacture and marketing of an object. Production notes\nThe photographic glass plate negative was photographed and produced in Australia, c. 1900.\nHistory Notes include facts about what has happened to an object since manufacture. This could include who owned it and how it was used (provenance). It may also describe any cultural meanings with which it may have become associated. History notes\nThe donor Raymond Phillips was a rotograver and for many years was responsible for the Australian Women's Weekly cover. His father, Arthur Phillips, was a gold and silver merchant and was possibly the photographer of the glass plate negatives. In 1920, the family moved from Willoughby to Latimer Road, Bellevue Hill. A bachelor, Raymond Phillips remained in the house after his parents' death. The slides were found in a deal box in the garage.\nAcquisition credit line\nGift of the Estate of Raymond W Phillips, 2008", "authorname": "Blue States", "id": "24762863-3094323190-72157611052944739", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3094323190/#comment72157611087349977", "realname": "", "path_alias": "malagabrielle", "author": "53473996@N00", "iconserver": "21", "datecreate": "1229065768", "_content": "I think this could be a photo of the notorious newspaper editor <a href=\"http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A110048b.htm\">John Norton's</a> house;  \nThe house was called 'St Helena' and was situated in Torrington Road, Maroubra.
