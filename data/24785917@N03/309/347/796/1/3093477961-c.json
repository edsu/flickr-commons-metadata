I speculate that a woman (wearing a dark dress) was seated and holding the baby -- and her left arm and hand was resting on top of the baby's ... thus it was kept in the final image (the opposite of how it was posed in <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3112020377/\">this photo</a>).\n\n2. The outline of a seated woman, similar to those in the series (with hat), can be seen in the final image (almost as a black &quot;shadow).\n\n3. To my eye, in the final print (below), the &quot;vertical grey-white stripe&quot; at the left of the photo is the arm of one of the chairs (from either work-print) -- while the &quot;image&quot; of the cane/wicker chair has been added. In fact part of the image of the cane/wicker chair appears to have been superimposed over the other chair. (Also see <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3229545239\">this chair</a>, and same baby, with a different background.)\n\n4. There is a fragment of the baby's hat (seen in Work-Print A) that remains in the final photo. (It is possible that this is a fragment of a cuff as shown in <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3112020377/\">this photo</a>.)\n\n5. The pattern of the fence in the background of both work-prints can be seen in the final photo.\n\n6. The baby's  face may have been manipulated (transplanted) from another image, and like the rest of the photo is heavily retouched.\n\n&quot;Small child wearing smocked dress&quot; by <i>Phillips</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3093477961/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/3202/3093477961_389cfbbbcc.jpg\" alt=\"Small child wearing smocked dress\" alt=\"Small child wearing smocked dress by powerhouse_museum\" /></a>\n\nThere are, of course, dozens of reasons why an isolated photograph of this baby could be desired.
