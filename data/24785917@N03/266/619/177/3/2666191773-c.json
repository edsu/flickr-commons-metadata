Parts had been butchered from several internal modifications over its life. I saw some of the internal column capitals in the main ground floor shopping colonade that had previously been removed for alterations being replaced by thin fibreglass moulds so not all is as it seems!!! They also did a cheap job on the floor tiles - hideous compared to the rich detail and deep colours of the original tiles that still survive in some parts of the building, mainly the stairways.\nAs I recall, Ipoh Ltd wanted to demolish the QVB but the owner, the City of Sydney, required restoration for the 99 year lease in return for signiificant height development gains on Ipoh's other development site - now known as World Square.
