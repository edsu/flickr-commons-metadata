Now I've been there I'm not so sure it's exactly the right place, I thought it was Macquarie St looking east along Shakespeare Place but so much has changed in the area.  Even the statue is different, the original statue on a square plinth with a single figure, the &quot;new&quot; one on a rounded plinth with others around the base.
