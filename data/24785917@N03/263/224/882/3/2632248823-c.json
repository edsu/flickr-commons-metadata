Many similar photographs are showing up in the State Records NSW photostream on Flickr.  My idea is that the prints are the documents the relevant Government department required, but the glass negatives from the unnamed photographer eventually became part of the Tyrrell collection.", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-2632248823-72157621993196237", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2632248823/#comment72157624782817737", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1283939278", "_content": "A print on Flickr from State Records NSW - \n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4625663816/]", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-2632248823-72157624782817737", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2632248823"}}
