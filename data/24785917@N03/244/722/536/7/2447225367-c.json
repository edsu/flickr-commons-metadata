Rowlands' farm 'Werribee', also near Cowra. The Delaney brothers were winners of the Prize Farm Competition, Rowlands was placed second. Presumably the pic was taken at one of these two farms, but I've discovered that the Sydney Mail sometimes padded out their feature articles with pics from their photo archive...so pending further info emerging we probably can't be too emphatic re the location. [anyone from Cowra with a camera out there?]. The Sydney Mail caption is 'Baling Hay'. \n\nThese  other pics from the PHM Tyrrell Collection also appeared in this SM article:\n\n <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2581842471/\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2581842471/</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2362683483/\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2362683483/</a>", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "24762863-2447225367-72157630816511312", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2447225367"}}
