This railway cutting, reputedly the deepest (or is it steepest) cutting in N.S.W., was part of the original main southern railway line, which was bypassed by the current line in 1919. It became known as the Loop Line and is now used only by trains from the Thirlmere Steam Museum, for part of its length. The cutting is just to the north of Hill Top, the most northerly settlement on the Southern Highlands and some 20kms from Mittagong.", "authorname": "Wardie44B", "id": "24762863-2448026362-72157623407496429", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2448026362"}}
