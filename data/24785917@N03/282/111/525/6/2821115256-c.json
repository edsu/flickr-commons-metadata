The starboard mainplane hit the ground and the Hudson bounced onto its port mainplane. The crew appear to have been uninjured. \n\nAt first it was decided to convert the aircraft to spares, but then instead it was shipped by sea to Sydney for repairs by Clyde Engineering NSW- thus being the first Hudson repaired in Australia.\n\nIt was received by 24 Squadron RAAF in July 1941 - and this may be the photograph of the handover ceremony.\n\nIt crashed and burned on take-off from Lakuvai Aeriodrome at Rabaul, New Britain on 23 November 1941.\n\nIt was stripped of parts and left there.\n\n[ This information is synthesised from these internet sources:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.adf-serials.com/2a16.shtml\">www.adf-serials.com/2a16.shtml</a>\n\nPhotograph number 001091 @ the Australian War Memorial:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.awm.gov.au/\">www.awm.gov.au/</a> ] \n\n\n\nA search for the serial number of this aricraft &quot;A16-31&quot; on the Powerhouse Museum's own website Collection Search brings up 13 photographs of this aircraft including the one shown above.\n\nADDED:\n\nThis photograph is also significant because it is an exemplar of the wider surge in Australian industrial activity of the World War II era.  Prior to World War II, Australia often imported manufactured goods, particularly those which required advanced technology.  By 1940 and 1941, with supply lines to overseas industry in the United Kingdom already limited due to the war with Germany and Japan's looming entry to the war Australia became more reliant upon homeland industry to meet the needs of wartime production.  \n\nIn fact other photographs of &quot;aircraft&quot; set in this photostream show how the Clyde Engineering works turned its attention to this important task:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/sets/72157607114457184/\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/sets/721576071144...</a>", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "24762863-2821115256-72157607337457110", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2821115256/#comment72157632824336141", "realname": "lifeasdaddy ...a guy, his wife, and their son...", "path_alias": "lifeasdaddy", "author": "13267298@N00", "iconserver": "3144", "datecreate": "1361524825", "_content": "At the persistent URL back to the Powerhouse Museum record for this image there is this information:\n\n&quot;A rectangular black and white silver gelatin glass plate negative in landscape format.
