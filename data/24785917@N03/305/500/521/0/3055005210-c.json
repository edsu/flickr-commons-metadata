The guns were four-inch Mark III type.\n\nMy reasons for this identification are:\n\n1) a three-gun broadside mounted high, low, high as we see in the photo. The first and third guns are on the same deck level, number two gun is a deck below. Only the Alert Class (Alert and Torch) were so armed in the Royal Navy.\n\n2) the single funnel and absence of copper sheathing. HMS Torch was single funnelled and steel sheathed. The vessel above appears steel sheathed.\n\n3) probably British as shown by the crew's uniforms.\n\nThe only vessel which seems to fit is HMS Torch as her sister ship HMS Alert served on other stations.  HMS Torch was in Australian and New Zealand waters from 1897 onwards:  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alert_class_sloop#HMS_Torch\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alert_class_sloop#HMS_Torch</a>\n\nYou will note that the Wikipedia photo shows her still rigged around 1900 while the above photo shows no spars. I suspect the absence of spars on the masts is merely because she is in dry dock.\n\nThe Victorian livery marks this as 1903/1904 or earlier. I would guess that this is HMS Torch probably undergoing refit upon her arrival on the Australian station.\n\nPlease add to:  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/navalhistory/\">Naval History</a>", "authorname": "Whipper_snapper", "id": "24762863-3055005210-72157617146452425", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3055005210/#comment72157622176590192", "realname": "Canterbury Heritage", "path_alias": "christchurch", "author": "23091738@N00", "iconserver": "196", "datecreate": "1251563538", "_content": "<img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8-DyTsoQSeI/SpjiwYrPBzI/AAAAAAAAIBY/1mZZa7MGtHo/s320/IMG_0145.jpg\" />\n\nHMS <i>Torch</i> at Lyttelton, NZ, circa February, 1898 (1156  x 857 pixels)\n\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8-DyTsoQSeI/SpjiwYrPBzI/AAAAAAAAIBY/1mZZa7MGtHo/s1600-h/IMG_0145.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">3.bp.blogspot.com/_8-DyTsoQSeI/SpjiwYrPBzI/AAAAAAAAIBY/1m...</a>", "authorname": "Canterbury Heritage", "id": "24762863-3055005210-72157622176590192", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3055005210/#comment72157623438891957", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pentax10d", "author": "8668775@N06", "iconserver": "5098", "datecreate": "1267853508", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1018543@N24/\">Circa</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "zona di fotographia", "id": "24762863-3055005210-72157623438891957", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "3055005210"}}
