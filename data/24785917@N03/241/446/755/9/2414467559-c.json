This image certainly proves the point.\r\n\r\nMaking the negative the primary object vs. the print is one among many major limitations for a large-format photographer. The limitations are the motivation for creativity, but in a documentary endeavor, there are situations where cropping is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe photographer intended to have the detracting edges of this scene cropped. More importantly, the foreground, angling up left to right, would have been dodged revealing detail.\r\nThe 2/3 rule was used to attain a sense of depth. The re-production of this image with  the light area on top and a dark area on the bottom is subverting depth. Dodging the foreground would enhance the sense of depth. \r\nPeople who create images are compelled to do so by the urge to share what they see. They chose subject, light, and vantage point based on an ideal and work the negative to a print that represents that ideal.\r\n\r\nYour careless reproduction of this image is a perversion of their ideal - the photographer who took the image is rolling in his/her grave.\r\n\r\nKeep it up, you make my work look all the better and remind me to take my negatives when I go.", "authorname": "Robert W Peabody III", "id": "24762863-2414467559-72157604565740118", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2414467559/#comment72157604585084722", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "22549175@N02", "iconserver": "5504", "datecreate": "1208440118", "_content": "A scan will by-pass a bad printing technique, contact or otherwise.\r\nYou will have all the data from the negative, but you still have to \u2018conduct the symphony\u2019.\r\n\r\nA score is made up of notes\u2013 in a negative, the notes are degrees of exposed and unexposed silver.
