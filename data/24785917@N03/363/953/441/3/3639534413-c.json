This original bridge only carried one lane of traffic in each direction as well as a tramway. It featured a swing section on the southern end of the bridge that could be opened to permit sailing ships and steamers with high funnels to pass. Colliers from Newcastle would require the bridge to be opened to gain access to the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) gasworks site at Mortlake, (now redeveloped as Breakfast Point). The bridge stood on iron cylinders with a sandstone pier at each end of the bridge. The sandstone piers are all that remain today of the original bridge.&quot;\n\nThis photo must be from the northern end - the swinging section is at the other end.  No sign of a tramway electrics - perhaps it was not yet built at the time of this photo (c.1895?)", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-3639534413-72157620116250065", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3639534413/#comment72157622058123635", "realname": "Luc", "path_alias": "la_buff", "author": "37426109@N07", "iconserver": "4026", "datecreate": "1251621240", "_content": "Were there not steam trams before the advent of Electric trams?
