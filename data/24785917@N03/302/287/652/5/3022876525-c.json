The result was a big turn-around from the first test of the series held at Sydney in December 1897, where England won by 9 wickets, with both Maclaren and Ranjitsinhji (who was sick) making centuries, and Hearne taking 9 wickets for the match. Despite being hammered first up, Australia won all the remaining matches of the series by significant margins, wrapping things up 4-1. To an extent, this 1897-1898 series was marred by the bad behaviour of the Australian crowds, who relentlessly hooted the English team in what was then considered to be an unsporting manner. Ranjitsinhji, in particular, incurred the wrath of the crowds following comments he made in the press about Australian fast bowler Ernie Jones, whose bowling action was deemed by many to be questionable. Jones was in fact no-balled for throwing during the second test at Melbourne. For the English team, one of the biggest disappointments of the tour was the poor form of fast bowler Tom Richardson, who was evidently plagued by fitness and alcohol related issues. Richardson has often been regarded as one of the best fast bowlers ever to play the game, but by 1897-1898 his career was in decline.", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "24762863-3022876525-72157630310559424", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3022876525/#comment72157630325745928", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1340876570", "_content": "Also see this pic - <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2609378489/\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2609378489/</a>", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "24762863-3022876525-72157630325745928", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "3022876525"}}
