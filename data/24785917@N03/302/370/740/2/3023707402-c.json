(ref 3'4'5) This is a distinctive feature which can be seen on many photographs. It became the backbone of the network with pole routes branching off at every cross street. The pole route in this section of George Street was replaced by a smaller one carrying only telegraph wires. The cable support was superseded before 1900 but was not all demolished. Shopkeepers had been allowed to use it to support awnings, and where they had done so it was left in place.  &quot;\nRef.-  <a href=\"http://www.telephonecollecting.org/lightpoles.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.telephonecollecting.org/lightpoles.htm</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-3023707402-72157623353593826", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3023707402/#comment72157623353832054", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1265335578", "_content": "The poster for the &quot;Grand Commonwealth Fair&quot; occurs in several pictures of George Street, implying they must be contemporary to the event at the Town Hall in November / December 1899.
