October 1901.\n\nThe four lower level Bent St statues were added in 1892-1893 (l-r: Blaxland in ca. May 1893, Wentworth on 5/3/1892, Robertson in ca. September 1892, Cunningham in ca. January 1893). Of the two middle level Bent St statues, Lawson appears to have been added during the second half of 1893...one newspaper item indicates he was in place by January 1894. Farnell was a later addition (some time between June 1901- and October 1903). In this pic we can see two of the first level statues (Blaxland and Wentworth), and one of the middle level statues (ie. Lawson)...and the vacant niche beside Lawson, later occupied by Farnell. \n\nThe four Gresham St statues occupy lower level niches. Deniehy appears to have been the first added (ca. October 1901). Grey appears to have been added at about the same time. I have yet to find dates for Parkes and Martin...they appear to have been added in 1902. In this pic we can see the vacant niches later occupied by Deniehy and Martin.\n\nSee my comments re the Lands Office statues here - <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5401920179/\">www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5401920179/</a>", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "24762863-3023701142-72157631320320676", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "3023701142"}}
