The building consisted of basement &amp; 6 upper levels.It was one of the earliest examples of a fire-resisting structure. The structure was of wrought iron beams &amp; floor beams encased in terra cotta blocks. The staircase was also fireproof. The fa\u00e7ade was clad in Pyrmont stone &amp; the granite columns from Scotland.It had a 28m frontage to Wynyard St &amp; 14m frontage to George Street .Topping out in June 22,1889, it was the citys tallest building for a few short months Although buildings such as Chief Sec Bldg &amp; Mort &amp; Co woolstore were approx same height of 102ft/31m, this building was built using the \u201cskyscraper \u201c method.

The motto on the statue is: 'Praevisa mala pereunt', which I gather means 'Evils foreseen are destroyed' (or something similar). This pic appears to show the work of chalk graffitists.

There's a little bit of debris on the mezzanine level parapet (looks a bit like cigarette buts!), and some of the pillars appear to be marked by something like bird droppings, but there's no great accumulation of the stuff, there's no accumulation of soot or grime, no water marks and rust stains, etc. So my hunch is that this pic was taken not long after the opening, ie. in late 1890 or early 1891.\n\nI gather that Troedel Cooper &amp; Co were a Sydney branch of the Melbourne printing and lithography firm Troedel &amp; Co. TC&amp;Co appear to have operated in Sydney from ca. early 1890 thru to early May 1894, when Troedel &amp; Co (the Melbourne firm) went into liquidation. They appear to have been at 41 York St (cnr York and Erskine Sts) until mid-late 1892, after which they moved to 81 Clarence St. In January 1891 there was a sizeable fire at 41 York St but TC&amp;Co appear to have remained there afterwards...until mid/late 1892. I'm not convinced that their sign which we see in this pic is attached to 41 York St. I might be wrong, but it looks to be attached to a building in Carrington St. Maybe they rented a space on a nearby building for their sign, which might have remained there regardless of where they moved...so the sign mightn't be much help in dating this pic...beyond giving us a range ca. 1890-1894.\n\nPer the digitised newspapers, the Colonial Deposit and Discount Bank was a shonky money lending operation run by a swindler named Hastings Likely. The 'Bank' appears to have had an office at Otis Chambers, 82 King St from 1889 thru to ca. 1892, after which it appears to have ceased trading. During 1893-1894 Hastings Likely featured in a number of civil cases brought against him by people who he'd duped (a widow, a miner from the bush, etc). He was bankrupt by 1894. Of course the sign might have stayed up for some time after the 'Bank' had become past tense, but given it was occupying valuable advertising space, there's also a good chance that it might have been removed soon after the 'Bank' folded in 1892.\n\nC.A. Sherwin evidently leased a turkish bath in Bligh St during the 1880s. From the bit we can see here it's impossible to tell whether the sign was an advert for the Bligh St turkish bath, or for another turkish bath. But per this notice Sherwin's lease at the Bligh St bath ended on 30 April 1890 (column 3, 10th from bottom) - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13768977\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13768977</a>\n\nWallach Bros flash new furniture warehouse at the corner of York and Clarence Sts opened in the later 1880s - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71098642\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71098642</a> ; Wallach Bros appear to have gone into receivership in about 1893-1894 (maybe another casualty of the severe 1890s economic depression).\n\nR.W.
