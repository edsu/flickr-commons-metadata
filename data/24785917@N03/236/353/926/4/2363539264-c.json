They don't seem to be with their separate families - One can see a few adults in the background standing guard, watching.  Only one child is completely bare standing at the edge of the waves, another in underwear.  I get the feeling they aren't even with this group of children at all.  Very few seem to be taking advantage of the ocean.  Most all of the children (students ?) are wearing full public dress.  Girls are wearing standard white dresses, some with smock aprons, hats, stockings and shoes are on.  Boys in full dress and hats as well.  Where are their bathing costumes?  This group seem to be observing the water rather than enjoying it for seaside activities, early 1900s to 1910s...", "authorname": "DominusVobiscum", "id": "24762863-2363539264-72157605571451079", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2363539264/#comment72157612652073556", "realname": "Sergio seLusaVa Carioca Copacabana", "path_alias": "selusava", "author": "35699605@N00", "iconserver": "3803", "datecreate": "1232143162", "_content": "Awesome!", "authorname": "seLusaVa", "id": "24762863-2363539264-72157612652073556", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2363539264/#comment72157622546394753", "realname": "", "path_alias": "kingkongphoto", "author": "36277035@N06", "iconserver": "3539", "datecreate": "1256603026", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1062833@N25/\">Best Vintage Images on Flickr</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Kingkongphoto & www.celebrity-photos.com", "id": "24762863-2363539264-72157622546394753", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2363539264/#comment72157626501350343", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1304297462", "_content": "Henry King (the photographer) took another photograph minutes earlier a little to the left - \n\n&quot;No.1440 Bondi Bay Sydney (H.King Syd:)&quot;  NAA, Dated 1894\n\n<a href=\"http://vrroom.naa.gov.au/print/?ID=18905\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img src=\"http://vrroom.naa.gov.au/Images/Bondi beach1_11777746_tcm11-17571.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"75\" /></a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-2363539264-72157626501350343", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2363539264/#comment72157626636742815", "realname": "Jonathan Berry", "path_alias": "highranger", "author": "86916510@N00", "iconserver": "7306", "datecreate": "1305861791", "_content": "Shark proof swimming costumes..... choke hazard :-)", "authorname": "Highranger", "id": "24762863-2363539264-72157626636742815", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2363539264/#comment72157628742869619", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1325839983", "_content": "The other photo's glass negative (&quot;No. 1440&quot; as above) is also in the Tyrrell Collection - <a href=\"http://from.ph/30668\" rel=\"nofollow\">from.ph/30668</a>\n\nAlso the the reverse view (&quot;No. 1439&quot;) - <a href=\"http://from.ph/30667\" rel=\"nofollow\">from.ph/30667</a>\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/]  These additional images found via a Trove search for &quot;Bondi Bay&quot;.
