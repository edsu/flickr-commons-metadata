There are differences caused by the strong sunshine and contrast in this picture - a building disappeared (was it the Hotel Australia?).  This photo is a full plate glass negative; the other is half plate.  In this photo the tram wires have been purposely whited out (see persistent URL).  \n\nThe best proof comes from the two carts on the left hand kerb (see note) - the one in front has the same arrangement of parcels in both pictures - see Persistent URL.\n\nThe tram wires (post December 1899) and the absence of electric lights (pre 1904) should help date the photos.\n\nOr maybe I missed something?!", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-2362685537-72157623522087000", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2362685537/#comment72157623398829977", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "47572660@N08", "iconserver": "2736", "datecreate": "1267329415", "_content": "Sorry, beachcomberaustralia, I thought there were buildings missing up the Macquarie Street end.
