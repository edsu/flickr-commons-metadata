Nimmitabel is a small rural [village], located south of Cooma in New South Wales.&quot;<i><a href=\"http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=28473\">[1]</a></i>\n\nThe windmill was built in 1865.  Also known as Nimity Belle. About 1840 the locals started calling the village Nimoitebool.  On Townsends map in 1845 as Nimmitabel.<i><a href=\"http://www.monaropioneers.com/cooma.htm\">[2]</a></i>&nbsp; Also Nimmitybelle, Nimithybale and Nimitybell. Nimmitabel means, &quot;the place where many waters start and divide&quot;.<i><a href=\"http://www.policensw.com/region/southern/monaro/lac/mo12.html\">[3]</a></i>\n\n&quot;This old flour mill (1865-72) was built almost single-handedly by a German settler named John Geldmacher who also owned a store and other town allotments. He initially fitted sails but these were not permitted so close to a road where they tended to frighten horses. Thus he used horses to drive the mill which was not a great success. It was later a timber mill and is one of two such mills left in eastern Australia.&quot;<i><a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-factsheet/nimmitabel-20081113-5yte.html\">[4]</a></i>\n\n<b>Geldmacher's Mill &ndash; Then and Now</b> (100+ years later)\n\n&quot;Old Windmill - 2008&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp;by<i> Kincuri </i> &nbsp;&nbsp;|  &nbsp; &quot;Old Windmill, c. 1900&quot; by <i>Kerry</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/30490987@N04/3162241467/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/3258/3162241467_06a32af9fc_m.jpg\" alt=\"Geldmachers Mill - Nimmitabel 3\" alt=\"Geldmachers Mill - Nimmitabel 3 by 30490987@N04\" /></a>  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2363505730/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/2283/2363505730_78df8351bd_m.jpg\" alt=\"The Old Windmill, Nimitybelle\" alt=\"The Old Windmill, Nimitybelle by powerhouse_museum\" /></a>", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "24762863-2363505730-72157615819626510", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2363505730"}}
