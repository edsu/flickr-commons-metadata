The grade was too steep for engines, so a huge set of switchbacks were built.  The trains reversed direction for the middle leg.\n\nThe Main Western Line now bypasses the Zig Zag with a series of tunnels, but some <a href=\"http://www.zigzagrailway.com.au/\"> lunatic volunteers have restored the line</a> and run steam trains up and down on most weekends.  They run motor rail cars on weekdays.  It can be accessed along the Darling Causeway Rd at the top, and in Lithgow at the bottom.", "authorname": "iansand", "id": "24762863-2363527006-72157615912299462", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2363527006/#comment72157624126693515", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1276257694", "_content": "Charles Bayliss - <a href=\"http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/pictoria/gid/slv-pic-aab71415/1/a14903\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.slv.vic.gov.au/pictoria/gid/slv-pic-aab71415/1/a14903</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-2363527006-72157624126693515", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2363527006/#comment72157628923441339", "realname": "Steve Pearson", "path_alias": "fotoshoppe", "author": "52118584@N04", "iconserver": "4081", "datecreate": "1326880075", "_content": "iansand - I gather you use the term 'lunatic volunteers' in the nicest possible way.", "authorname": "Geurie 2818", "id": "24762863-2363527006-72157628923441339", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2363527006/#comment72157628926291041", "realname": "Ian Sanderson", "path_alias": "iansand", "author": "45104424@N00", "iconserver": "3796", "datecreate": "1326899054", "_content": "<b>&gt;Geurie 2818</b> Absolutely.
