I live in Wollongong (NSW, Australia) where there are suburbs named Port Kembla and Figtree. This image has made me wonder if a) this is a tree native to the region and b) if Figtree is named after it. I'll be sure to report back with my findings :)", "authorname": "alyssa.maree", "id": "24762863-2363510802-72157624417116418", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2363510802/#comment72157626278861693", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "61344864@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1301637950", "_content": "This image is taken on the Cordeaux road approx two kilometres west of the Wollongong suburbs of Figtree and Unanderra in a westerly direction . The ridge in the distant background to the left of the tree was known as the &quot;saddleback&quot; which joined Mount Kembla (mountain) to the ridges which ran north south above Kembla Heights .Mount Kembla (mountain) is out of view on the left ...The small hill to the left behind the tree was once known as Violet Hill and contained dairy farms . This area is now known as Cordeaux Heights and has been subdivided and contains many houses , roads a school and shops . On the extreme left foregound the rail line  from Mount Kembla Colliery to Port Kembla carried coal to the wharf . At the time of the image there was horse and coach teams that travelled  between Mount Kembla -Kembla Heights and Wollongong . One of these teams can be seen crossing the American Creek .. There does not appear to be a bridge at the time of the image . A wooden bridge was later built and still later this bridge was replaced with a concrete bridge . The Fig Tree in the image started to decay and was removed because of a danger to road traffic  .The area where the image was taken was then known as Central Kembla as it was midway between Mount kembla Colliery and the wharf where the coal was off loaded from rail wagons to ships which came to be known as Port Kembla . There was another large Fig Tree which was near the Princes' highway bridge which crossed the American Creek . This tree was in sight from the Figtree Hotel and is considered to be the Fig Tree from which the suburb of Figtree obtained its name", "authorname": "Buckley 1942", "id": "24762863-2363510802-72157626278861693", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2363510802"}}
