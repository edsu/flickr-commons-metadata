Per various digitised newspaper hits, Tornaghi appears to have been at 298 George St during the later 1880s and early 1890s (so he can't help us pin down the year in which this pic was taken)...By the 1880s, Tornaghi had established his reputation as one of the leading instrument and clock makers in NSW, and by then he'd successfully provided clocks for a number of public buildings both in Sydney and in the country. In 1887 Tornaghi won the contract to fit the clock and bells for the GPO tower. However before long he had issues with hanging conventional bells in the tower and opted instead for tubular bells, contrary to the provisions of the contract. In the end, following delays and controversy, and unable to win support for his tubular bells, Tornaghi was dumped, a new contractor was appointed and a clock and bells were ordered from Britain...eventually being installed from about July 1891 and then officially set in motion by Lady Jersey in September 1891. It's probably not quite correct to suggest that Tornaghi was responsible for the vacant space in the GPO clock tower which we see in this pic, but he certainly had something to do with it!
