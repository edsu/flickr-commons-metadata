May 1889...but there also appears to have been a Carrington Chambers at 6 Castlereagh St...it's not entirely clear whether the building name was transferred from 30-32 Castlereagh St to 6 Castlereagh St, but just going on modern street numbering and Google Maps, the 'Carington Chambers' we see in this pic looks like it might have been at 6 Castlereagh St rather than at 30-32 Castlereagh St...\n\n\nHawkes &amp; Co advertised themselves as 'successors to Buchan Thomson'...they ran a coaching, livery and horse hire business...they appear to have moved to new premises in the Tattersall's Building at the corner of Castlereagh &amp; Hunter Sts in ca. April 1883 (2nd notice, column 2) - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70998784\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70998784</a> also see their advert here - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70967599\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70967599</a> ... Hawkes &amp; Co appear to have operated at the Tattersall's Building until early 1888, when they drop off the radar...the proprietor died in 1884 <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13562348\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13562348</a> ...and I've encountered one notice which indicates that the business was subsequently run by trustees...possibly until ca. 1888...I'd say that in this pic we see the Tattersall's building at the corner of Castlereagh &amp; Hunter Sts, during the period Hawkes &amp; Co were there, ie. 1883 to ca.1888...\n\nUnion Club, Bligh St - <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2733974683/\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2733974683/</a>\n\nColonial Secretary's Building - <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/3793507471/\">www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/3793507471/</a>", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "24762863-2363484098-72157630802305040", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2363484098"}}
