It now sits in Victoria Park, Chippendale.  This park is adjacent to the University.\n\nThe Gardener's Lodge was built in 1885.  The architect was Edmund Blacket, who also designed the main building of the University.\n\nThe Gardener's Lodge was classified by the National Trust in 1976.  Externally it is in very good condition, however internally it is quite dilapadated.\n\nBlacket's mark is all over Sydney of the 1800's, much surviving today.\n\nFor more on Blacket:\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Blacket#University_of_Sydney\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Blacket#University_of_Sydney</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A030165b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A030165b.htm</a>", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "24762863-2362674113-72157612075459665", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2362674113/#comment72157624794070098", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1282614786", "_content": "I am pretty sure this photo wasnt taken in Broadway.
