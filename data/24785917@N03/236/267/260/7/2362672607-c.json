My note is just what is written on that triangular pediment, see the Persistent URL link above at full blast enlargement (amazing feature at the PhM).  It might help date the photo - 'centennial' implies post-1888, and  'A. Butler' might be in some records somewhere.  Most Henry King photos seem to be c.1890, but I am slightly suspicious of the gent's boater straw hat which seem to have become fashionable around 1900.\n\nThe building there now (see streetview) has the same curly art nouveau verandah woodwork - is that now the Taralga Cafe?", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-2362672607-72157637470843814", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2362672607/#comment72157637471369584", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1383990794", "_content": "In May 1906 (probably much later than this photo) - \n\n<blockquote>\n<i>Fire at Centennial Stores.--The chimney attached to the residence of Mr. A. Butler, of the Centennial Stores, was recently completely burned down through the internal woodwork getting alight in some way. Fortunately the fire was seen at an early stage, and plenty of assistance was at hand. The arrangements made by Mr. Butler to cope with an outbreak of fire are excellent, and their utility was amply proved on this occasion. A number of elevated tanks are fixed at the back of the residence. These are always kept full, and have hose attached, so that a good head of water is available in a few minutes. The damage, some five or six pounds, is covered by insurance.</i>\n</blockquote>\nFrom - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/104772237\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/104772237</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-2362672607-72157637471369584", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2362672607/#comment72157637471485255", "realname": "", "path_alias": "blackdiamondimages", "author": "97974874@N00", "iconserver": "5084", "datecreate": "1383993884", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia]  Thanks.
