How did you get interested in that, and where do you find your information?\n\nPresumably you cannot climb a chimney stack when it is belching smoke, so this photo must be 1904 (whilst Anthony Hordern's New Palace Emporium was being built).  I wonder if the photographer was Melvin Vaniman who was climbing all around Sydney in 1903-4.
