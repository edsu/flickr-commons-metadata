Palmer and Sons as the commercial sponsor. Hikers purchased a two-shilling train ticket and joined a train from Central Station to a mystery destination. The hikes, held on Sundays, were enormously popular. The third Mystery Hike from Cowan Station to the Hawkesbury River on 26 July 1932 used 12 trains to carry almost 8,000 participants.\n\n&quot;Mystery Hike No. 2 was from Valley Heights in the lower Blue Mountains along the old Lapstone Road to Penrith on 10 July 1932. Four trains conveyed approximately 2,000 hikers.&quot;\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "24762863-3403201361-72157616583850240", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3403201361/#comment72157626698873397", "realname": "h\u00e9ctor m.s.", "path_alias": "hhhhhhhhe", "author": "57474088@N02", "iconserver": "3218", "datecreate": "1306574203", "_content": "great photo <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hhhhhhhhe/\">www.flickr.com/photos/hhhhhhhhe/</a>", "authorname": "h\u00e9ctor m.s.", "id": "24762863-3403201361-72157626698873397", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3403201361/#comment72157628694825929", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1325577628", "_content": "These mystery hike pics are fantastic! The hiking craze probably originated in Britain. In Australia the craze spread to most of the capital cities and was at its peak in ca. 1932-1933. In Sydney, some  individual hikes attracted thousands of participants. Most of the hikes were organised by the capital city radio stations (who attracted sponsors), in conjunction with the state railway departments. For the most part the hikes followed roads and by-ways on the  fringes of the cities, and involved entertainment by radio stars of the day, mass sing-alongs, etc. The mystery hikers were quite a different crowd to the bushwalkers of the day, who were more interested in walking in more remote bush areas. In some Australian cities railway mystery hikes continued at irregular intervals into the later 1930s, though by this stage they attracted fewer participants.\n\nFor more info on the 1930s hiking craze see Melissa Harper's excellent article 'A Battle for the Bush: Bushwalking versus Hiking between the Wars', Journal of Australian Studies, no. 45, June 1995; also see the PHM description at the purl above. There's also quite a bit of info on the mystery hikes if you search the National Library of Australia digitised newspapers.", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "24762863-3403201361-72157628694825929", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3403201361/#comment72157635431010500", "realname": "Fabiana Apel", "path_alias": "fabianaapel", "author": "59527711@N03", "iconserver": "3781", "datecreate": "1378610576", "_content": "Una de las mejores fotos que vi jamas...", "authorname": "fabianaapel", "id": "24762863-3403201361-72157635431010500", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3403201361"}}
