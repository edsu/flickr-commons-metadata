At Middle Head there are two forts, the &quot;<b>outer</b>&quot; and the &quot;inner&quot;.  In the former are seven guns, all muzzle-loaders ; four 80-pounders, of 6in calibre, rifled with three grooves ; one 18 ton rifled Armstrong, muzzle-loading, rifled with seven grooves, fitted with patent hydraulic buffers; and <b>two 25-ton Armstrongs</b>, rifled on the Woolwich system, with 19 grooves, and fitted with Elswick compression plates. These latter are perfect models -- &quot;regular beauties&quot; our guide, the bombardier; calls them -- and are loaded and cleaned by machinery ; the loading being performed completely under cover, and the machinery being so delicately adjusted that one man can train and another elevate these &quot;infants&quot;. \nThe penetrative power of the &quot;pills&quot; dispensed from these patterns, from the widely-celebrated Armstrong Works, in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, is something impressive. Those pills can penetrate through a wrought-iron armour plate 18 inches in thickness, their effective range being with 12 degrees of elevation, 8200 yards.  All these guns are mounted <i>en barbette</i>, and so placed that the traverse of one gun overlaps that of the others. The 80-pounders command the harbour from George's Head to Hornby Light, the Armstrong sweeping the entrance from Watson's Bay to Clontarf.  ... ... &quot;\n</blockquote>\n\nAlso the guns arriving (one sank!) in 1882 - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/70967871\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/70967871</a> \n\nAnd the AWM pictures of 1893 the 10 month &quot;Long Course&quot; when (I think) the guns were removed - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/71219166\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/71219166</a>\n\nSo this gun was a 10-inch Rifled Muzzle Loading (RML) 25-ton Armstrong,  at the Outer Middle Head defences before 1893.\n\nPhew!", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-3283283663-72157632088161752", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3283283663/#comment72157632101066731", "realname": "Doug Richards", "path_alias": "dougthebear", "author": "38293973@N08", "iconserver": "3559", "datecreate": "1353921770", "_content": "This book contains some good information on these guns, and how the British didn't even buy them, that the loading mechanism was overly complicated and how, as sold to the colony of NSW the mechanism that was meant to deal with the recoil was not up to the task.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.gould.com.au/Fragile-Forts-Fixed-Defences-p/amh026.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.gould.com.au/Fragile-Forts-Fixed-Defences-p/amh026.htm</a>\n\nThe information quoted above was so much hype.\n\nThe guns fired one round every three minutes, that is, one round in the the time it took a ship at the time to travel 800 metres or so at around 12 knots.  In other words, they would have got off only two or three shots off between the time that the target came into view coming around the heads and the ship getting close enough so the guns could not depress far enough to be effective.  As naval and coastal gunnery generally requires a number of aiming rounds before hits are achieved, the guns would have been quite useless and more for propaganda value to appease the concerns of the populace.  In similar ways the three guns in the tower at Fort Dennison were unable to traverse, meaning that they could only shoot at a target that actually presented itself to them.  The government could claim though that the harbour was defended by the guns of Fort Dennison though.  The gun on the top of the tower was the only effective gun at Pinchgut.", "authorname": "dougthebear", "id": "24762863-3283283663-72157632101066731", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3283283663/#comment72157632105832982", "realname": "Doug Richards", "path_alias": "dougthebear", "author": "38293973@N08", "iconserver": "3559", "datecreate": "1353929855", "_content": "Please see my images of this location and similar sites at  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.panoramio.com/user/3368565\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.panoramio.com/user/3368565</a>", "authorname": "dougthebear", "id": "24762863-3283283663-72157632105832982", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3283283663/#comment72157633461787736", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1368177215", "_content": "Similar but different gun at Middle Head requiring expert identification and location, just posted by the ANMM - \n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8721332695/]", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-3283283663-72157633461787736", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3283283663/#comment72157634135521109", "realname": "Doug Richards", "path_alias": "dougthebear", "author": "38293973@N08", "iconserver": "3559", "datecreate": "1371300811", "_content": "I would suggest not Middle Head, more likely South Head.", "authorname": "dougthebear", "id": "24762863-3283283663-72157634135521109", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3283283663/#comment72157634140683128", "realname": "Doug Richards", "path_alias": "dougthebear", "author": "38293973@N08", "iconserver": "3559", "datecreate": "1371301127", "_content": "Other possibility: this gun is a 9in 12 ton RML at Georges Heights (Not 'Middle Head')", "authorname": "dougthebear", "id": "24762863-3283283663-72157634140683128", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3283283663/#comment72157634218908879", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1371687866", "_content": "Excellent 1877 interactive map showing the positions of the various gun emplacements (obviously does not show later alterations) - <a href=\"http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview/?pi=nla.map-rm1400-sd&amp;rgn=0.1954314721%2C0.0773830461%2C0.8045685279%2C0.9215617306&amp;cmd=zoomin&amp;width=1200&amp;x=1108&amp;y=400\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview/?pi=nla.map-rm1400-sd&amp;rgn=...</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-3283283663-72157634218908879", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3283283663/#comment72157634474985947", "realname": "Doug Richards", "path_alias": "dougthebear", "author": "38293973@N08", "iconserver": "3559", "datecreate": "1372943973", "_content": "Actually I retract my comment about not Middle Head.
