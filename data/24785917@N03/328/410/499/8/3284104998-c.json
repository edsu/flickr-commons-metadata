Not easy when you have never been there and you are 400 kms away.  But thanks to Google maps, satellite photos, and Google Street view, I can  say that it is ...\n\nBALLAST POINT, Birchgrove, looking north-west to Snail's Bay. \n\nMost of the houses on the left are still standing, and a trip along Wharf Street using Google Street View will confirm roof lines, chimneys, etc match this photo.  Btw Powerhouse Museum Collection, the houses are definitely NOT &quot;Federation style&quot;;  late Victorian Italianate (and some earlier) is more like it.\n\nWhere the three gents are sitting, Ballast Point, shows up as a deserted Texaco / Caltex site on the satellite picture.  Just last year (11/7/2009) it was again declared a public park. Pity this photo was not identified for that.   I imagine the rock the gents are on has long been quarried away, but a field trip and now photo would be terrific.
