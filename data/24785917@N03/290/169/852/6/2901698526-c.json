It was by a strange way of fate that New Chum Hill; a rich gold-bearing ground came by its name. A party of two or three men, newly arrived from Great Britain, pitched their tent beside that of another tent which belonged to a party of miners who were working a claim on a flat through the centre of which, ran a branch of the main river. Next day the \u2018new chums\u2019 as all new arrivals were called, inquired from the more experienced miners as to the most likely place to set in to work. \u201cStart and drive a tunnel into that hill yonder\u201d, answered one of them in a joke, indicating a place where gold was the least likely to be found. To the astonishment of everyone and amid jeers of the onlookers, the tunnel was driven into that hill. In a few days the gold was struck, marvellously rich. Then the miners wondered and said, \u201cWho would have thought it?\u201d The new chums made their pile in a few short months, and returned to Great Britain to enjoy their easily-earned fortune. \n\nFrom<a href=\"http://wikiski.com/wiki/index.php/Australian_Geographical_Name_Derivations\">here</a>", "authorname": "iansand", "id": "24762863-2901698526-72157608837765948", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2901698526"}}
