That is where these warehouses were, fronting on to east Circular Quay.  The recognizable buildings of the National School (National Trust now) and The Observatory (just built in 1858) help with triangulation.\n\nLooking west from Government House gardens (Tarpeian Way?)\n\nLuckily there is an interactive 1858 map of Sydney, which helps - <a href=\"http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.map-rm1272-sd&amp;rgn=0.3821928460,0.3504692301,0.4988335925,0.4501287268&amp;width=1200&amp;cmd=zoomout\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.map-rm1272-sd&amp;rgn=0...</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-4091217376-72157625157815147", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/4091217376/#comment72157629151223753", "realname": "Andrey Timofeev", "path_alias": "timodrey", "author": "60866881@N08", "iconserver": "3816", "datecreate": "1328237131", "_content": "Well!

It will form a gratifying souvenir and an interesting and valuable present for friends at home. The ALBUM comprises a succession of views, presenting a correct and graphic illustration of the Site and Character of our Fine Metropolis, guiding the spectator from the entrance of the Harbour, along its picturesque shores, to the Quays and Principal Buildings, and making him acquinted with the Australian Bush, &amp;c.\nThe ALBUM contains 36 slides, and one additional one taken expressly for the subscriber, representing either a Likeness, Family Group, or any other subject, or, instead of this, six additional slides of his collection, whioh consists of about 80 different views.\nThe price of subscription is \u00a35 5s.</blockquote>\n\n- <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/60403477\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/60403477</a>\n\nBy the wording of the advertisement, it would seem Hetzer's first set of 36 Sydney stereoscopic views was issued in 1859 not 1858, as indicated on the Photo of the Day blog.\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia/] Note Degotardi a few entries above advertising himself, in German, as a printer of a German monthly magazine -\n\n<blockquote>DEUTSCHE MONATSCHRIFT. - Soeben ist das IV.
