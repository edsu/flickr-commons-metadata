I gather this pic was taken at one of the top chord centre joints on 10/9/1930, the day the top chord  was joined (the lower chord having been temporarily joined a few weeks previously).\n\nOver at SRNSW they have a number of pics dated 10/9/1930 which were taken at this same  location...including this one <a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.asp?digitalid=12685_a007_a00704_8730000083r.jpg&amp;B1=Search\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.as...</a> ...judging by the position of the steel 'packs' which we see here in the foreground, it appears that this PHM collection pic was taken on the same day.\n\nOver at NSW Transport RMS they have the same SRNSW pic (albeit in reverse) with an  accompanying caption, which identifies Hipwell...<a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/168965247?q=nuc:NRTA+sydney+harbour+bridge&amp;c=picture&amp;versionId=184170214\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/work/168965247?q=nuc%3ANRTA+sydney+harbo...</a> ...like the chap in this PHM collection pic, Hipwell is wearing what appears to be a white cardigan underneath his suit jacket. My only reservation with the caption is that it appears to have mistaken Ralph Freeman for Frank Litchfield...which might perhaps raise questions re the accuracy of the caption as a whole. Freeman's SMH article on the closure of the top chord (link below) suggests he wasn't at the top chord on 10/9/1930.\n\nHipwell is also identified in this other NSW Transport RMS pic  <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/168706425?q=bradfield;+ennis;+litchfield;+hipwell;+butler&amp;l-availability=y&amp;c=picture&amp;versionId=183899671\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/work/168706425?q=bradfield;+ennis;+litch...</a> ...the PHM version provides a better view (zoom in on the PURL version) <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/8283744212/in/photostream\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/8283744212/in/pho...</a>\n\nI gather Hipwell also appears in this PHM collection pic <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/8282715717/\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/8282715717/</a> ...and he can also probably be tentatively identified in a number of other Harbour Bridge pics from the various collections.\n\nThis 1932 SMH feature article includes a pic of the Dorman Long &amp; Co Harbour Bridge staff <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page1157143\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-page1157143</a> ...the resolution isn't great...here we see Hipwell in the front row lhs...\n\nFor interest, here's Ralph Freeman's fascinating article on the closure of the top chord which appeared in the SMH the following day - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16670396\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16670396</a> ; this equally fascinating video (which includes commentary by former NSW Public Works Department engineer Frank Litchfield) more or less describes what's going on in this pic...it covers the joining of the lower and upper chords from ca. 12:00 thru to ca. 19:50 - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPQ7CzVHdMs\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPQ7CzVHdMs</a>\n\nHere are some of the other SRNSW collection pics dated 10/9/1930 taken at one of the top chord centre joints...here we see l-r: Lawrence Ennis and JJC Bradfield - <a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.asp?digitalid=12685_a007_a00704_8730000080r.jpg&amp;B1=Search\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.as...</a> ; here we see l-r: Gordon Stuckey, RJ Butler, Frank Litchfield (supervising engineers with the NSW PWD) - <a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.asp?digitalid=12685_a007_a00704_8730000082r.JPG&amp;B1=Search\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.as...</a>\n\nI wonder whether it might be possible to identify some of the chaps in overalls...the blokes who actually built the bridge. They all appear to be wearing everyday shoes with leather soles. Not a harness, safety line or hard hat in sight.", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "24762863-8283755242-72157632460203774", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/8283755242/#comment72157632569392617", "realname": "Powerhouse Museum", "path_alias": "powerhouse_museum", "author": "24785917@N03", "iconserver": "7409", "datecreate": "1358728174", "_content": "Added note based on @quasymody great research listed above", "authorname": "Powerhouse Museum Collection", "id": "24762863-8283755242-72157632569392617", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "8283755242"}}
