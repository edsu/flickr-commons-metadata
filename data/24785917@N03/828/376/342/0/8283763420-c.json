Any takers?\n\nIn this pic we see the bloke in overalls in front of Ennis with one of the hydraulic jacks which were used to keep the two spans in position a precise distance apart whilst the final joins were made. It looks as if the jack has just been dropped into place...the blokes over on the left might be connecting the hydraulic lines.\n\nI suspect this pic might have been taken on 8/9/1930...over at SRNSW it appears in their sequence of Harbour Bridge pics following a pic taken on 8/9/1930, which shows the hydraulic and screw jacks in position at one of the top chord centre joints - <a title=\"Hydraulic+and+Screw+Jacks+in+Position&amp;B1=Search\" href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.asp?title=Hydraulic+and+Screw+Jacks+in+Position&amp;B1=Search\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.as...</a> ; <a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.asp?digitalid=12685_a007_a00704_8730000076r.JPG&amp;B1=Search\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.as...</a> \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/8283755242/\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/8283755242/</a> I'm fairly sure we also see Hipwell in this pic (taken on 10/9/1930 at the top chord) and also the bloke in overalls in front of Ennis...but if so, then going on the clothes they're wearing, the two pics appear to have been taken on different days.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPQ7CzVHdMs\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPQ7CzVHdMs</a> this fascinating vid describes how the top chords were joined (between ca. 15:00-19:45)", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "24762863-8283763420-72157632385818561", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/8283763420/#comment72157632448747960", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1357439536", "_content": "From the SRNSW sequence of Harbour Bridge pics, we can see that parties of engineers (Ennis, Bradfield, etc) were at the top chord centre joints on 8/9/1930, 10/9/1930 (the day the top chords were joined) - <a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.asp?digitalid=12685_a007_a00704_8730000081r.jpg&amp;B1=Search\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.as...</a> , and 12/9/1930 - <a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.asp?digitalid=12685_a007_a00704_8730000091r.jpg&amp;B1=Search\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.as...</a> ...and for all we know they might have made visits on other days as well.
