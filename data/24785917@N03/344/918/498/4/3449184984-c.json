Palmer and Sons as the commercial sponsor. Hikers purchased a two-shilling train ticket and joined a train from Central Station to a mystery destination. The hikes, held on Sundays, were enormously popular. The third Mystery Hike from Cowan Station to the Hawkesbury River on 24 July 1932 used 12 trains to carry almost 8,000 participants.\n\nMystery Hike No. 2 was from Valley Heights in the lower Blue Mountains to Penrith on 10 July 1932. Four trains conveyed approximately 2,000 hikers. This photo shows a group of hikers at Central Railway Station next to locomotive 3352 which bears a sign 'Palmers Mystery Express'.
