The street has tram tracks and overhead lines. As the box in which these negatives were found is labelled 'All British Cabs. / at Nestles' it is possible that the cabs are in Great North Road, Abbotsford, where Nestle's had its factory. Some registration plates are visible on the vehicles - NSW Taxi Cabs 103, 399, 1994, 378, 331, 677, 303, 72, 1001, 1953, 1491, 105, 979 and 566.
