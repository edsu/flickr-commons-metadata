Davies appears to have moved there with his wife and family in ca. the mid 1870s, but it's unclear whether he built the house, or whether it was already standing, and he simply provided the name. John Davies died in 1891, and the property was subsequently sold, but the name was retained. During the 1930s 'Leddicott' was used as a school. I suspect it became past tense by the later 1930s.\n\nThere's a Frank Sparkes painting of 'Leddicott' which evidently dates from the 1880s...on an art dealer's web page if you care to search...it's not a Streeton, but it's kind of nice.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.art.net.au/art-detail.asp?idImage=1401&amp;idArtist=268\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.art.net.au/art-detail.asp?idImage=1401&amp;idArtist=268</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.asp?digitalid=4481_a026_000713.jpg&amp;B1=Search\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.as...</a> - same view as the Sparkes painting...different day!", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "24762863-2469694614-72157630837215158", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2469694614/#comment72157633186439928", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1365332343", "_content": "! *#**! - Wow!
