Evidently it is possible to date old photos in Sydney from the type of pole.  Technology was changing so rapidly between 1880 and 1920, that every few years a type of pole was replaced.  \n\n&quot;The backbone of the public telegraph network was a route in George Street from the telegraph office [GPO George Street] to Redfern Station and a shared route along the railway line to Parramatta. By 1880 there were about 10 wires along George Street. This pole route appears from the General Post Office c.1890 on Arthur Streeton's 1893 painting of Redfern Station.&quot;   And on this photo.  I would dearly like to say that they are contemporary, but it is raining in the painting and sunny in this photo.\n\nMore telephone pole info: <a href=\"http://www.telephonecollecting.org/lightpoles.htm\">www.telephonecollecting.org/lightpoles.htm</a>\n\nbtw there is an excellent explanation of where this station was on the PH site Persistent URL above.  It is not the current Redfern Station, or Central Station.  I was very confused until I read it, and always wondered why Arthur Streeton would have bothered to paint a picture of a suburban station in the rain.", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-2469669056-72157616652137097", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2469669056/#comment72157618860804711", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1243570836", "_content": "Another view from the State Records NSW photostream dated  04/10/1890 - \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/2654873676/\">www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/2654873676/</a>\n\nOld Redfern Station was a popular subject.", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-2469669056-72157618860804711", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2469669056/#comment72157623740806024", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pellethepoet", "author": "47201412@N02", "iconserver": "2683", "datecreate": "1270044458", "_content": "&quot;I would dearly like to say that they are contemporary, but it is raining in the painting and sunny in this photo.&quot; - beachcomberaustralia\n\n[smile] Well, I can see some clouds gathering ...", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "24762863-2469669056-72157623740806024", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2469669056/#comment72157624132948783", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1276342607", "_content": "Charles Bayliss - <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=414262\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=414262</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-2469669056-72157624132948783", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2469669056/#comment72157624397609724", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1277970932", "_content": "Star Photo Co.
