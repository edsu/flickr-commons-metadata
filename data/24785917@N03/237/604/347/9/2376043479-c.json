That much is correct but, being a Wollongong boy and knowing the 'lay of the land', I believe that this image needs to be flipped horizontally. Then, the high part of the escarpment in the distance will be to the right, which would be correct, because that is Mt. Kembla and the terrain to the north of Mt. Kembla isn't flat, as depicted in this image. However, the terrain to the south is quite level for quite some distance. Having flipped the image around, I now believe and, in fact, know that the only stream in that area large enough (and in the right place) to be the one in the photo is Mullet Creek, which definitely is at Dapto. So, rather than getting the suburb wrong, I reckon the name of the creek is incorrect.
