The man with the upturned collar would attract some notice and the eyeglasses might seem a little eccentric but imagine women dressed in the style of the same era fitting into any modern scene.  \n\nThe width of neckties and lapels changes and &quot;European style&quot; clothes are a little more closely tailored but if a man who works where conservative dress is the norm can hold onto his out-of-style things until they rotate back into fashion again.  I can't think of a department store that has more than one floor dedicated to men's clothing.", "authorname": "Max Penn", "id": "24762863-4903877528-72157624709439415", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4903877528"}}
