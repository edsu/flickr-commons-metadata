This track went across the face of the slope above the western entrance to the Grand Arch then zigzagged up to the saddle then zigzagged down the eastern slope to the original entrance to Lucas Cave. The track is still there, although very much overgrown. The road that can be seen in the background is part of Cambridges's road built in 1878.
