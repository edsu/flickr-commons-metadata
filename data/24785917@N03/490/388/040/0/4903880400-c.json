It was not originally a hotel and even contained the Sydney Council for a couple of years. It became a licensed hotel in 1875 and was not named the Imperial until 1913. By 1919 it was a warehouse for the wholesaler next door. The terraces were slowly demolished throughout the early 20th century and the former Imperial Hotel was demolished in the early 1920s.
