I believe it is a rural location.\n\nIt was not unusual for rural cottages to have picket fences.  The fence to the right and left of the picket fence is a strained wire fence with corner straining posts cut from tree trunks, and the other fence posts of the wire fence are split from trunks, probably hardwood.  The wire fence at right has chicken wire strung across the lower half of the fence, although this is not of itself a sign of a rural location.\n\nThe fact that there are no other residences visible in the photograph does signify a rural location.", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "24762863-3195833956-72157612552485634", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3195833956/#comment72157612552849724", "realname": "lifeasdaddy ...a guy, his wife, and their son...", "path_alias": "lifeasdaddy", "author": "13267298@N00", "iconserver": "3144", "datecreate": "1231928580", "_content": "This photograph shows three men, a young boy, and a younger girl.\n\nTwo of the men can be identified in the following photograph which also shows three men, a young boy and a younger girl.\n\nIt was probably taken on the same day:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3093483387/\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3093483387/</a>", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "24762863-3195833956-72157612552849724", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3195833956/#comment72157612563997458", "realname": "", "path_alias": "victor98_2001", "author": "30444654@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1231952553", "_content": "great shot", "authorname": "victortan47", "id": "24762863-3195833956-72157612563997458", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3195833956/#comment72157612647799544", "realname": "Gene Morris", "path_alias": null, "author": "34307192@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1232133695", "_content": "The house shows two fireplaces.
