The church with the spire almost in the middle of the photo is the Baptist Church, Kiama, which appears to be still pretty much as seen in this image. The Post Office is the building with the 3-storeyed tower closer to the left of the image. (Sorry, I don't know how to make those little 'ID' boxes.) The hill from which the photo was taken has been residential for many years, so the cows have long gone.", "authorname": "Wardie44B", "id": "24762863-2429895169-72157623531151164", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2429895169"}}
