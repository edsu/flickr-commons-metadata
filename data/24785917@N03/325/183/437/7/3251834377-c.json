The run-down buildings are part of the original whaling station; no longer there, except for 'The Barn', out of shot. See  <a href=\"http://www.afloat.com.au/afloat-magazine/2008/august-2008/Mosman_Bay_Footbridge\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.afloat.com.au/afloat-magazine/2008/august-2008/Mosman...</a>   for more footbridge information.\n\nMore importantly, the buildings are in the famous Tom Roberts painting of &quot;Mosman's Bay&quot; 1894.  See  <a href=\"http://save-mosmans-bay.com/painting.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">save-mosmans-bay.com/painting.html</a>  and an enlargement <a href=\"http://save-mosmans-bay.com/images/Mosmans\" rel=\"nofollow\">save-mosmans-bay.com/images/Mosmans</a> Bay-1.jpg .  \n\nThe photograph and the painting seem to be at a similar time (1894) judging from the similar costumes and lack of other buildings. There are a lot of pictures in this collection of Mosman and Cremorne.   Could it be that the photographer knew Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton, and others at the artists' camp at Little Sirius Cove just over the hill behind?  A huge leap of the imagination, I know, but what if those people, who are appearing in several group shots, are Streeton, Roberts, etc.?!", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-3251834377-72157613313196001", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3251834377/#comment72157613373330151", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1233870769", "_content": "There are several discrepancies, which I suppose you put down to artistic licence.  For instance a missing chimney and wharf wooden railings on the painting.  The painting also has a large black (incongruous imho) sign in front of the buildings - the back of it shows up here  on the persistent URL magnification.\n\nThe more I research, the more I have a hunch that a lot of these pictures were taken by Tom Roberts, who is described as an artist AND photographer.  The same-ish group of people and boats pop up in many photographs - they are obviously friends of the photographer, and 'pose' for the pictures looking directly at the camera (except the women!).   Many of the picures are beautifully composed, like a painting.\n\nI am having no luck (yet) getting a match with faces from biographical websites.  Presuming  Tom Roberts is behind the camera, but the other men could include Arthur Streeton, Charles Conder, Fred McCubbin, Girolamo Nerdi, AH Fulwood, Julian Ashton, etc.   HELP NEEDED please from an expert!\n\nMore about the Heidelberg School, links to paintings and biographies:  <a href=\"http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/heidelbergschool/sydney/\">www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/heidelbergschool...</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-3251834377-72157613373330151", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3251834377/#comment72157613498777954", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1234084262", "_content": "A painting by Albert Henry Fullwood (1863-1930) &quot;Mosman's Bay&quot; [ca.1904] clearly showing the bridge, looking north up the bay:  <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an2288936\">nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an2288936</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-3251834377-72157613498777954", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3251834377/#comment72157613469542291", "realname": "lifeasdaddy ...a guy, his wife, and their son...", "path_alias": "lifeasdaddy", "author": "13267298@N00", "iconserver": "3144", "datecreate": "1234085438", "_content": "Here's another photograph of the bridge, bay, and buildings viewed from up the hill to the left:\n<a href=\"http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=385883\">www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=385883</a>", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "24762863-3251834377-72157613469542291", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/3251834377/#comment72157613589594786", "realname": "lifeasdaddy ...a guy, his wife, and their son...", "path_alias": "lifeasdaddy", "author": "13267298@N00", "iconserver": "3144", "datecreate": "1234262040", "_content": "beachcomberaustralia - you are corerct about the location.
