The 'up' road to the right is slightly overgrown, and has piles of  wood left over from fence building scattered around, almost dangerously.  The main ruts in the road run from the right hand bottom corner to the left 'down' road, implying that the main track comes from behind; this is not a 'corner' it is a junction.  This is confirmed by the sign (&quot;CYCLIST'S! [sic] DANGEROUS HILL&quot; + emblem (old Mosman Council?)), which points  the wrong way for any cyclist already coming down the right hand track!\n\nI believe it is the junction of Rangers Avenue and Park Avenue in Mosman, which, together with Avenue Road behind the camera, were some of the earliest roads or tracks in Mosman 110+ years ago.  Up the right hand track just around the corner was &quot;The Rangers&quot;, an early homestead.  The road down the hill led to Mosman Bay;  the road behind joined Avenue Road.\n\nThe Google Maps Street view is almost unrecognisable:  \n<a href=\"http://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=mosman&amp;sll=-25.335448,135.745076&amp;sspn=43.119414,79.101563&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-33.832338,151.236318&amp;spn=0.002464,0.004828&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=-33.83228,151.236235&amp;panoid=x-wKivzkhkmuCjxRVvzlJQ&amp;cbp=12,241.27990017382464,,0,4.5433140783326715\">maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;...</a>\n\nBut why?  So what?  This location is a couple of hundred metres away from the Mosman waterfalls, pre-Reid Park Mosman Bay pictured in the same collection.  The 'corner' caught the artist / photographer's eye for its perspectives.  Is there a Roberts or Streeton painting which uses this view?", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "24762863-3252656160-72157614106226308", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3252656160"}}
