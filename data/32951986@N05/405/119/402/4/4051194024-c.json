The 1961 book Baseball In America, as well as a 2004 New York Times article and even an anonymous letter to The Sporting Life in 1887 (thought to be a teammate of Creighton) all mention him as the first pitcher to throw a fastball and a changeup (which he called his &quot;dew-drop&quot;), and as such he revolutionized the position. \n\nHe and his team, Excelsior of Brooklyn, made what is believed to be the first national baseball tour, sparked by Creighton's success in the pitcher's box. Creighton suffered what turned out to be a fatal injury, incurred while swinging a bat, and died at his parents' house several days later. There are differing accounts as to what caused his death; some say it was a ruptured bladder, others a ruptured spleen, appendix, or even an inguinal hernia (John Thorn of SABR offers that explanation). Regardless, the team erected a 12-foot marble obelisk, topped with a large baseball, at his gravesite, and his photo appeared in the team program for several years afterward. \n\nHe was only 21 years old. As far as I know, the first fatal injury suffered during a pro baseball game.", "authorname": "divinehammer", "id": "32946646-4051194024-72157626741636633", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4051194024"}}
