Gabrielson</i></b>, whose business is pictured here at 821 Broadway, is also present in the historical record; and for doing that most &quot;New Yorker&quot; of things -- namely writing a letter to the editor of <i>The New York Times</i> (July 1870), regarding yet another war, this time in Europe. (I know the particulars; spare me -- please!)\n\nHere are a few curious facts, obvious to the keen observer of this picture: A tree was cut-down for clearance so anyone could more easily see from a distance that this was the location of the <b><i>U.S. Sanitary Commission</i></b> agency. It also made practical the suspension of an upper-floor flag pole; doubtlessly hastily added to give a more officious appearance to a structure that might otherwise have been a haberdashers location at one point. (This neighborhood wasn't exactly one that people would have normally associated with government offices, at that time. However, there was a war on and, jingoism aside,  times being what they were relative to labor shortages and real-property rents...well, you get the idea. $$$ You take the space you can find, and best afford. I can only imagine how <i>thrilled</i> Mr. Gabrielson was with his new neighbors, too.)\n\nPeace!", "authorname": "Dux Sauce Demigod", "id": "32946646-3110852092-72157625155385250", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3110852092"}}
