Nowadays there is a road in front of the torii over some land gained to the sea. \nThe other coast we see in this beautiful photo is Kita-Kyushu, the northern part of the next japanese island: Kyushu.\nThe strait is only about 1 Km wide here, between Honshu and Kyushu islands. Since some decades, there is a tunnel that link them under the water and a famous bridge.\nAnecdotically, Shimonoseki was the first japanese village ever visited by a culturized european (he was the basque priest Francisco Xabier, in 1550) and, ten years ago, the japanese institutions built a monument dedicated to him just at some meters to the right from the location of the photographer who originally took this picture.", "authorname": "Shanti Basauri", "id": "32946646-3110692578-72157631577976767", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "3110692578"}}
