Or nearby if I'm not ;)\n\nNagasaki University has several picture postcards of <a href=\"http://oldphoto.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/jp/target.php?id=233\">this bridge</a>.\n\nNagasaki University says this is on the <a href=\"http://sepia.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/jp/target.php?id=435\">Numa River</a> (\u6cbc\u5ddd).  In another photo they say that it's in the area of Numa or or Suzu Rivers (\u9234\u5ddd), which appear to come together just before the harbor.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb and make a different guess.\n\nI believe this is at the location of the current Heike Crossing Bridge (\u5e73\u5bb6\u8d8a\u3048\u306e\u6a4b, heike-goe no hashi) on the Wada River (\u548c\u7530\u5ddd) in Fuji City, Shizuoka.  At the time the photo was taken this was in Suruga-no-Kuni.  This was on the Tokaido just before <a href=\"http://www.yoshiwara.net/news/index.html\">Yoshiwara Stage</a> (\u5409\u539f\u5bbf), the 14th from Nihonbashi. (Yoshiwara Stage was located around Yoshiwara 4-5, Fuji, Shizuoka from 1680 on - I mistakenly referred to the original location near current JR Yoshiwara Station before)\n\nReasoning... \n1) Taganoura Harbor (\u7530\u5b50\u306e\u6d66\u6e2f) is in Fuji City, which lies in the old Suruga district.  This is 100% certain.  \n2) There are five rivers that lead into Tagonoura.  Of those, only one lines up with Mt. Fuji visible in the background at the Tokaido crossing point - others never turn that far north and west when headed upstream.  That is Wada River.  On the Urui River, for example, Fuji is seen looking across the bridge, not up the river as the <a href=\"http://www.geocities.jp/hitosht/ckaido/tokaido3/31yosiwara2.html\">fifth photo on this site shows</a>.\n2b) The Tokaido crosses the Numa River just north of the current JR Yoshiwara Train Station.  The bridge is pointed mostly towards Mt. Fuji - the river is totally east and west.\n3) Over Wada River, Heike Crossing Bridge is the link of the Tokaido.  (I'm not sure if the bridge was given this name when built in 1987, or if the previous bridge also had this name.)\n4) Heike Crossing is important in Japanese history, which would make it a tourist destination on the Tokaido and worthy of a picture postcard.  In 1180 the Fuji River Battle (\u5bcc\u58eb\u5ddd\u306e\u6226\u3044), part of the Genpei War (\u6e90\u5e73\u5408\u6226) took place at this spot.  The Fuji River occasionally changes its course, and in 1180 ran through what is now Wada River into the harbor.  The war is the frame for the the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tale_of_the_Heike\">Tale of Heike</a>, one of the early Japanese literary classics.  It appears in many Edo era paintings and plays.\n\nI haven't been here and can't find evidence about whether the rivers have been channelized and changed by man.  So I can't conclusively say it's Wada.  A map with Meiji coastline and rivers would settle the issue quickly.\n\nFWIW, &quot;Fujiyama&quot; isn't so weird.  Only as weird as &quot;Nippon&quot;.  (not &quot;normal&quot; but correct.. using them has a definite nuance)  Now, Tokio and Karuisawa are definitely weird, though. :)", "authorname": "Rob Ketcherside", "id": "32946646-3110697078-72157611623026280", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nypl/3110697078/#comment72157611560347469", "realname": "Rob Ketcherside", "path_alias": "tigerzombie", "author": "29056926@N02", "iconserver": "3136", "datecreate": "1230194145", "_content": "Oh... &quot;Tagonoura Bridge&quot; is apaprently the name of <a href=\"http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;FORM=LMLTCC&amp;cp=35.1451~138.684947&amp;style=r&amp;lvl=18\">this bridge</a>.
