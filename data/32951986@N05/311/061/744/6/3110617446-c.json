Each apartment had 7 rooms and 4 working fireplaces where we burned cannel coal in the winter. The owners selected tenants as creative artists. The building was full of writers, painters, sculptors. Both my parents were artists. The Asiatic curator for he Metropolitan Museum lived on the top floor and his relative, the queen of The Netherlands visited when I was there. At one time a scene from the film &quot;The Kiss of Death&quot; where Richard Widmark throws an old lady in a wheel chair down the stairs was shot there.   Louise Bourgeois, the sculptor, lived there at the same time I did. There was an old doorman named John who kept an eye on things like bicycles in a room adjoining the entrance. The poet Ann Lauterbach lived there as a child - she was 12 years old when I knew her. Her father, Richard Lauterbach, was an editor for Life magazine and subsequently worked with the newspaper PM.
