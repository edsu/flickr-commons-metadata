My Mom is from Halls and I still have relatives in Mphs.  Mom loved to dance and she has told me stories about going to Estes Park to jitterbug on the weekends, so the poster brings back that memory.  Also, the Double Cola advertisement.  We had a Double Cola bottling plant right down the street from where I lived as a little girl.\nIn the 60s and 70s Beale Street was really run down and dangerous.  Most of the stores had closed.  The renovation that took place in the 80s has made Beale a fun and safe place to visit.", "authorname": "Divemaster Green", "id": "32946646-3110571760-72157626533273819", "iconfarm": 7}], "photo_id": "3110571760"}}
