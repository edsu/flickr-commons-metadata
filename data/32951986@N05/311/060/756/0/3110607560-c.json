Born in New Amsterdam (now known as \u201cManhattan\u201d), De Peyster came from a prosperous mercantile family.  He quickly ascended the City\u2019s political ladder, occupying almost all of the important colonial offices, including alderman, mayor, member of the king\u2019s council, and acting governor. De Peyster amassed great wealth, and by the end of his life he is said to have been one of the city\u2019s wealthiest merchants.&quot; --<a href=\"http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=11245\"><i>NYC gov parks</i></a>\n\nThe statue was originally placed in the center of Bowling Green Park in 1896, at a site once occupied by a statue of King George III. It was removed to Hanover Square Park in 1972, and is currently in storage whilst Hanover Park undergoes redesign as the British Memorial Garden, and a new site is selected for reinstallation.", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "32946646-3110607560-72157615391112559", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "3110607560"}}
