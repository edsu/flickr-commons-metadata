In February 1865, they turned to building a church for themselves. Poplar Grove Church was designed by Captain Michael H. McGrath, Commander of Company F, in part to replace the Poplar Springs Church that had been destroyed during the Battle of Peebles Farm. The new building, which seated about 225, was built entirely of materials gathered from the woods, including stripped logs, saplings, and bark. Soldiers brought their own three-legged stools into the church with them. Intended as an auditorium for profane as well as sacred uses, it was first utilized for a strolling minstrel show.</blockquote>", "authorname": "BigBean", "id": "32946646-3110837278-72157623222548215", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3110837278"}}
