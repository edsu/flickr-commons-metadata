That photo's comment says that the building in the center of this photo is the Grand Hotel's original building (kyuu-kan, \u65e7\u9928), construction started in Meiji 3 (1870).  Other photos say it was completed in Meiji 6 (1873). \n\nA photo of the hotel from <a href=\"http://content.lib.washington.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/ic&amp;CISOPTR=115&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=17\">1908 in UW collection</a> is tough to place in this one, because it is taken from the opposite side of the buildings, showing <a href=\"http://global.mitsubishielectric.com/tasteofjapan/foreigners/sarda/index.html\">the annex completed in summer of 1890</a>.\n\nBecause the roofline of the building to the left of the original hotel does not resemble the annex, NPL's photo must be between 1873 and 1890.\n\nAnother photo by Kusakabe Kinbei is held by Nagasaki University, <a href=\"http://oldphoto.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/jp/target.php?id=49\">showing the quite different facade of the annex</a> (shinkan). \n\nYet another in their large collection of Kusakabe prints <a href=\"http://oldphoto.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/jp/target.php?id=1836\">shows the annex alongside the original hotel from the water</a>.  A photo from the end of the bund (quay)  by an unidentified photographer <a href=\"http://oldphoto.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/jp/target.php?id=2743\">also shows both buildings of the hotel</a>.\n\nAn <a href=\"http://shotei.com/publishers/hasegawa/menu1895/menu1895.htm\">1895 menu</a>.
