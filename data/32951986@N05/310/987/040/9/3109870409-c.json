Nevertheless, note the combination of traditional Japanese style homes and Western-style ones.\n\nYokohama was made a major city more or less overnight (figuratively speaking) when, in the 1850s, it was made a treaty port and opened up not only to foreign trade but also to foreign settlement. Along with Nagasaki, Kobe, and Edo (later called Tokyo), Yokohama was one of the chief centers of European activity and influence in this period, and retains elements of that character today.", "authorname": "toranosuke", "id": "32946646-3109870409-72157617931514210", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nypl/3109870409/#comment72157620042720332", "realname": "Rob Ketcherside", "path_alias": "tigerzombie", "author": "29056926@N02", "iconserver": "3136", "datecreate": "1245566017", "_content": "@toranosuke: with your hint that you saw western-style homes, I made the assumption that we are looking at the Yokohama Bund (place of foreign business and settlement), and at the Yokohama Canal.  \n\nWhat bridge, though?  It's not the one at the end of the canal, visible <a href=\"http://oldphoto.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/en/target.php?id=104\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.\n\nSo I looked at an <a href=\"http://lunacommons.org/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~9~1~23199~70133:Shinkoku-Yokohama-ku-annai-zenzu---?trs=20&amp;mi=1&amp;qvq=w4s:/where/Yokohama-shi+(Japan);lc:RUMSEY~9~1&amp;cic=RUMSEY~9~1\" rel=\"nofollow\">old Yokohama map</a> on the David Rumsey site, and just started working my way up.  \n\nLucky for me, it appears that this is the second bridge, Maeda Bridge.  We're looking at it from the top of the 100 Motomachi Steps.  Here's <a href=\"http://oldphoto.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/jp/target.php?id=5566\" rel=\"nofollow\">another view from the top</a>, taken at a different time because some bulidings have changed.  Nagasaki University also has a view from the other side of the bridge <a href=\"http://oldphoto.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/en/target.php?id=3142\" rel=\"nofollow\">looking back at the cliff face</a>.\n\nIt should be rather easy to take a &quot;Now&quot; of this picture, assuming you can get to Yokohama.  There is a park right at the top of the old steps, called <a href=\"http://www.city.yokohama.jp/me/kankyou/park/yokohama/kouen047.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Motomachi Hundred-Step Park</a>.

If only I still lived in Yokohama, I'd gladly go and take that photo. I actually lived not far from that park, although I don't believe I ever came across this particular park, or realized any significance of it.\n\nThe name Maeda-bashi rings no bells. But it does show up as a still-extant placename on Google Maps. ... Looking at it on Street View, I realize I've crossed that bridge countless times while living there, just never realized the name of the bridge.\n\nVery very neat.

As recently as Google's streetview pictures (within a year?), the former head of the real Hyaku-dan steps was an empty lot surrounded by a low construction fence.  Someone better get there quick for the photo before construction starts!  It would look something like <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;sll=35.44777,139.630952&amp;sspn=0.010576,0.034847&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=35.439903,139.649202&amp;spn=0,359.999166&amp;t=h&amp;z=21&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=35.43983,139.649143&amp;panoid=vcSJmDP1QBJwv3NG4iX6iw&amp;cbp=12,330.18,,0,5.72\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>.\n\nSo far the only shot I've found online has been of Marine Tower, which someone caught with a telephoto lens through a cherry tree way off to the right.  Everything else is taken OF the park, not from the park.\n\nAnother Flicker user has posted an image from the bridge looking up, with a very colorful story.
