To the left is Niomon (now Hozomon), to the right is a pagoda, in the foreground is Benten Pond and a tea house.\n\nThe photo is from before 1887.  It was taken from right about <a href=\"http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;FORM=LMLTCC&amp;cp=35.713841~139.797699&amp;style=h&amp;lvl=19\">here</a>.\n\nNagasaki University has <a href=\"http://oldphoto.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/jp/target.php?id=159\">a very similar</a> shot by Kusakabe, panned left a bit removing the pagoda and adding a bridge center frame which is not visible here.  Another photo <a href=\"http://oldphoto.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/en/target.php?id=160\">is from a bit up the pond</a> and shows the bell tower\n\nThe landmarks in this photo don't match modern Tokyo.\n\nAn explanation is found in the description of <a href=\"http://lib.u-air.ac.jp/koshashin/asakusagojunoto.html\">another early Meiji photo</a> within a few meters of Kusakabe's.  The pond was filled in 1887 (another site says June, 1886), and the pagoda was burned down by US firebombing in World War Two.  The current pagoda is in a different location.\n\nA photo <a href=\"http://www.ndl.go.jp/scenery/e/data/21/index.html?type=map_o&amp;p=asakusa-ku\">looking up Nakamise Street towards Sensoji</a> in 1902 on the National Diet Library site shows the pagoda off to the right of the main temple.  Now it's located about where the clocktower can be seen.", "authorname": "Rob Ketcherside", "id": "32946646-3109868519-72157611804451605", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nypl/3109868519/#comment72157612538912289", "realname": "Rob Ketcherside", "path_alias": "tigerzombie", "author": "29056926@N02", "iconserver": "3136", "datecreate": "1232001210", "_content": "This photo was discussed in the Flicker Commons <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/flickrcommons/discuss/72157611835971819/72157612501107857/\">research tread</a>.", "authorname": "Rob Ketcherside", "id": "32946646-3109868519-72157612538912289", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nypl/3109868519/#comment72157619957836151", "realname": "Rob Ketcherside", "path_alias": "tigerzombie", "author": "29056926@N02", "iconserver": "3136", "datecreate": "1245566744", "_content": "Now:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/tigerzombie/3645845046/]", "authorname": "Rob Ketcherside", "id": "32946646-3109868519-72157619957836151", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nypl/3109868519/#comment72157621810989851", "realname": "Stephanie Fysh", "path_alias": "lu_", "author": "61361160@N00", "iconserver": "5330", "datecreate": "1249328694", "_content": "This photograph is featured in the Indicommons.org post <a href=\"http://www.indicommons.org/2009/07/30/traveling-photography/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Traveling Photography</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://indicommons.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://indicommons.org/images/indicommonsURL.png\" alt=\"indicommons.org badge\" /></a>", "authorname": "L\u00fa_", "id": "32946646-3109868519-72157621810989851", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nypl/3109868519/#comment72157627141418142", "realname": "Bernhard Scheid", "path_alias": "bluntschli", "author": "52251557@N00", "iconserver": "5331", "datecreate": "1310074469", "_content": "Thank you for this set from which I borrowed the above photo.
