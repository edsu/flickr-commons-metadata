They are aboriginal native people of Hokkaid\u014d, quite likely closely related to the aboriginal peoples (known as Emishi and by a variety of other names) destroyed or pushed north over the centuries as the Japanese (Yamato) state expanded. As late as the Edo period, Ezo was still not quite integrated into &quot;Japan&quot;, though the shogunate called claim over the whole island. There was only one feudal domain (han) on the island - Matsumae - which was tasked with essentially serving as march lords; overseeing relations and trade with the Ainu, defending the border from them, and from the Russians, who made advances on Ezo, and attempts to enter into relations with the shogunate on more than one occasion.", "authorname": "toranosuke", "id": "32946646-3109863739-72157617843334225", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3109863739"}}
