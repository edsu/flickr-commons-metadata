It was an experiment at completely redeveloping a neighborhood in fireproof brick.  In 1872 yet another massive fire spread through Tokyo.  Ginza Renga-gai was completed in 1877, designed by British architect and engineer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Waters\">T J Waters</a> (<a href=\"http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%e3%83%88%e3%83%bc%e3%83%9e%e3%82%b9%e3%83%bb%e3%82%a6%e3%82%a9%e3%83%bc%e3%83%88%e3%83%ab%e3%82%b9\">Japanese</a>).\n\nThe street itself was a first for Tokyo.  Pedestrian areas are separated from wheeled traffic, and gas lamps light the road at night.  Arcades visibile on the opposite side of the street were copied from Tuscany, while the entire street sceen evoked Regents Street in London.\n\nUnfortunately Waters' northern design skills created buildings that baked their occupants in Tokyo's hot summer months.  The street itself flooded horribly in Tokyo's typhoon season.  The brick neighborhood was not expanded beyond Ginza, for these reasons or perhaps simply because it was too abnormal for Japanese people to live in.\n\nRenga-gai was destroyed by the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923.\n\nThis photo predates the streetcar line visible in the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/iccho/388868354/\">Edo-Tokyo Museum model</a>.  A horse-drawn streetcar was installed in 1882, according to &quot;This Book Will Teach You All About Architecture&quot; (\u5efa\u7bc9\u306e\u3059\u3079\u3066\u304c\u308f\u304b\u304b\u308b\u672c, 2007), which I pulled most of this information from.\n\nThe colorization of this photo seems totally fanciful.  I haven't found evidence of anything but beigish or red color for the buildings.", "authorname": "Rob Ketcherside", "id": "32946646-3109868831-72157611535641813", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nypl/3109868831/#comment72157611806881055", "realname": "Rob Ketcherside", "path_alias": "tigerzombie", "author": "29056926@N02", "iconserver": "3136", "datecreate": "1230598760", "_content": "Meijitaisho.net has <a href=\"http://showcase.meijitaisho.net/entry/ginza_rengagai_01.php\">the same photo in black and white</a>.
