Some may wonder how this old photograph plays into the future of media, but I strongly believe that, while newspapers are gradually becoming obsolete, the media will eventually make a full cycle and bring the newspaper back.  The theory behind my prediction is the tetrad of media effects, which I learned about in a previous communication theory class.  Essentially, this tetrad questions what a certain medium enhances, makes obsolete, retrieves, and flips into when pushed to extremes.  I believe that, some day, print media will be retrieved in some way, shape, or form.\n\n-Karen Bonanno, BTMM 1655", "authorname": "Media Management @ Temple U.", "id": "32946646-3109788657-72157622922531416", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nypl/3109788657/#comment72157623597913771", "realname": "Ana Alas", "path_alias": "anaalas", "author": "81668141@N00", "iconserver": "3735", "datecreate": "1269811951", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1356792@N24/\">NEWSSTAND/QUIOSCOS DE PRENSA</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!\n\n<b>Invitada a - Invited to </b>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/newsagent-quioscos_de_prensa/\"><img src=\"http://dl6.glitter-graphics.net/pub/1411/1411716wk225izr3i.jpg\" width=\"148\" height=\"194\" alt=\"NEWSSTAND-QUIOSCOS DE PRENSA\" />\n<b>NEWSSTAND-QUIOSCOS DE PRENSA\nGracias por a\u00f1adir tu foto /Thanks for add !</b></a>", "authorname": "ABUELA PINOCHO \uf8ff", "id": "32946646-3109788657-72157623597913771", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3109788657"}}
