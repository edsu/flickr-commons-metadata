The first time I asked my dad about it we were going to or from Tannsboro's Trolley Valhalla Railway Museum which would have made it sometime in the late 1960's. I think we were waiting for a bus on White Horse Pike in Berlin. Dad told me it was because of the &quot;All Service Vehicles&quot;, but that the signs did not necessarily mean that the route had at one time used those vehicles.\nFrom what I think I read those used gasoline engines when they got to the end of the wire. I've often been a little curious why gasoline instead of diesel.", "authorname": "patrickphotos", "id": "32946646-3593436002-72157626560772848", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3593436002"}}
