Either one works.\n\nSome basic info on what's going on here can be found in the Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoshi\">Mikoshi article</a>.  \n\nThe article is bland and boring, though.  In contrast, the o-mikoshi is toured through the neighborhood once per year in the biggest festival the community is able to afford.  (great anthropological discussion in <a href=\"http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~bestor/miyamotocho_book.htm\">Neighborhood Tokyo</a> about how the o-mikoshi itself represents the community's fortunes)\n\nPeople are yelling, especially the strained men carrying the diety.  They stop frequently for breaks in the parade at the high rollers who donate to the shrine - the rice shop, sake shop, soy sauce shop (don't find these today!), retaurants.  After a couple drinks and small snacks, they heft up the shrine and bounce it furiously to the next stop.\n\nI love all of the panama hats.  It's the one thing that really looks out of place from a summer festival today.
