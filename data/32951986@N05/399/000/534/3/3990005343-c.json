Erected to secure the region against the French, the Fort is located near the town of Crown Point, New York and was the largest earthen fortress built in the United States.\n\nThe large earthen walls of the Fort are still visible today. A massive, accidental fire in April 1773 entirely destroyed the log and earth fortress, leaving the empty stone ruins of two barracks buildings standing. These ruins still stand and are being carefully preserved.", "authorname": "John McNab", "id": "32946646-3990005343-72157624375898906", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3990005343"}}
