This location is at the the incorporation lines of Kingston and Saugerties.\n\nAt the time, the industry required water power to drive locally quarried millstones as ESOPUS STONES composed of Shawangunk Grit (a quartz) quarried near ACCORD NY. \n\nThe process involved exposing lead 'buckles' (they were imported and probably not mined locally due to the poor quality) to vinegar contained in a clay jar. Lead oxide formed on the outside and was manually scraped off (though one patent claimed an automated process).\nThe lead oxide was then ground into in very fine powder, mixed with a binder and assorted pigments to make LEAD PAINT for a growing market.", "authorname": "anecdotalhistory", "id": "32946646-3991178318-72157629710527233", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3991178318"}}
