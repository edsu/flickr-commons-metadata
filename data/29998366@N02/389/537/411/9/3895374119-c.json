I don't remember leather school bags like these, the kind you wear on your back, though.  They were all the type with either one handle, like the one found on suitcases, or two longer loops held shut by a metal rod attached to the bag itself.   \n\nCuriously, it was the year before the army surplus shoulder bags became the big craze among students.  We would paint all sorts of things and symbols on them -- much like statements; but not gang-like...\n\nI also notice two of the girls here wearing tights, or <i>maillots</i> as we called them.  They would come in knitted (wool) and stretch (synthetic with lycra or its forerunner) versions, and were available in many dark-to-medium colors.   The girls in this photo may be wearing green and/or red :-)", "authorname": "tinamathis", "id": "29978018-3895374119-72157622255624303", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationaalarchief/3895374119/#comment72157622417294430", "realname": "", "path_alias": "it-is-aai", "author": "91271949@N00", "iconserver": "4", "datecreate": "1253462183", "_content": "spelfoutje in de titel...", "authorname": "it is aai!", "id": "29978018-3895374119-72157622417294430", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationaalarchief/3895374119/#comment72157622493203892", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "31633390@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1254392089", "_content": "Good ! \nThat right :))", "authorname": "L\u1eb6NG!", "id": "29978018-3895374119-72157622493203892", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationaalarchief/3895374119/#comment72157622540016424", "realname": "henni van dijk", "path_alias": "hennishots", "author": "26840188@N05", "iconserver": "5496", "datecreate": "1254973322", "_content": "mooie foto! ja de &quot;army' schooltassen werden tock pukkels genoemd?
