I just felt I had to reply to the blog post... I am including it here as well :\n\nThe debate about reality vs. aesthetics of photo has long been argued and will no doubt continue to be. Both versions of the photo continue to exist and have a purpose\u2026 but as an artist, I manipulate photos to bring out an inner beauty that is clarified by the removal of distractions. Another point is that the camera is a machine and only able to capture one moment in time, mechanically and without the higher processes of the human brain. The light, the shadow, the hard reality limited to 2 dimensions of what the machine records is not necessarily what our ever processing brains perceive, remember, or even register as seeing. I believe that photo retouching can simply create an image that is more close to what our brain perceives as it calculates the momentary changes in light and the three dimensional shape\u2026and perhaps even their emotional connection or response to the subject.I do not claim that is anything more that what is to own eye and no one elses. This photo, aesthetically has beautiful composition and lines and to my eye, I could see that ethereal theme of mother and child enhanced even more with some photo retouching. I didn\u2019t retouch this photo for any other reason but because it was interesting for me to work on it and see the results. I thought I would share it for whoever else found some value in it.", "authorname": "shelteringskies", "id": "29978018-3440985541-72157616773342972", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationaalarchief/3440985541/#comment72157621954828492", "realname": "", "path_alias": "fotoproze", "author": "41081439@N00", "iconserver": "157", "datecreate": "1249495478", "_content": "Wasn't Beatrix born in Ottawa?
