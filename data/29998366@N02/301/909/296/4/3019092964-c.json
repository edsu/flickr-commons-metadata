In fact it is clearly the Tommy, the English soldier, who is the prisoner: whereas the German troop is wearing full kit, the Englishman has been stripped of his combat equipment.  His shoulder strap hangs unfastened and his wallet has been hurriedly stuffed back into his unbuttoned tunic pocket, no doubt after being checked for documents of intelligence value.  This man, despite his wound, would have risked a severe dressing down had he appeared in his own lines in such a dishevelled state.  \n\nBut of course the real point is that such scenes took place on both sides of the front.  It is a terrible pity that the Christmas 1914 'miracle' truce did not spread and persist.", "authorname": "Primeval Nature", "id": "29978018-3019092964-72157613810192804", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationaalarchief/3019092964/#comment72157620592692154", "realname": "Keith Myerscough", "path_alias": "keithwm", "author": "16915040@N05", "iconserver": "3810", "datecreate": "1246025846", "_content": "PrimevalNature.com is probably right.
