While most Quads were made by the Morris motor company some were also made by Ford and by Chevrolet. While the Ford and Morris versions are very similar this is in fact a Chevrolet version with the drivers cab distinctively narrower than the crew section. The fact that this is a Chevrolet means that the soldiers unit is almost certainly Canadian. The gun in tow was likely to be either a 25pdr artillery gun or 17pdr anti-tank gun. The Quad was designed as such to be virtually useless as a general cargo transport. This so that in times of crises higher authorities wouldn't reassign the trucks elsewhere on the battlefield leaving the guns stranded.", "authorname": "Adrian Hamilton", "id": "29978018-4481720046-72157625641505546", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4481720046"}, "flarchive:created": 1387761504}
