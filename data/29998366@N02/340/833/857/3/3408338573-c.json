The settlement was formalized in 1658 as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haarlem\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nieuw Haarlem</a> (New Haarlem), after the Dutch city of Haarlem, under leadership of Peter Stuyvesant. The Indian trail to Harlem's lush bottomland meadows was rebuilt by eleven black laborers on behalf of the Dutch West India Company, and eventually developed into the Boston Post Road.\n\n&quot;After the English capture of New Netherland in 1664, the new English colonial administration renamed both the colony and its principal city &quot;New York,&quot; but left the name of Haarlem more or less unchanged. The spelling changed to Harlem in keeping with contemporary English usage, and the district grew (as part of the borough of Manhattan) into the vibrant center of African American culture in New York City and the United States generally by the 20th century.&quot;\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "29978018-3408338573-72157616545282235", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationaalarchief/3408338573/#comment72157616644758584", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pixelwrangler", "author": "43854658@N00", "iconserver": "5533", "datecreate": "1239500410", "_content": "Anyone know if that is St. Martin's Episcopal Church (Harlem), in the background?\n\nChurch is at <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=St+Martin's+Episcopal+Church,++230+Lenox+Ave.,+NYC&amp;vps=1&amp;jsv=153e&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=31.564064,60.029297&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ei=vyzhSbFjhsg1mM-Zzg8&amp;sig2=M0NHJy4vzHGSTbmCUSS3-w&amp;cd=1&amp;cid=40805467,-73946586,359188036344091427&amp;li=lmd&amp;z=14&amp;t=m\" rel=\"nofollow\">230 Lenox Ave.</a> (Malcolm X Boulevard), NYC.\n\nThis photo was taken in 1933.
