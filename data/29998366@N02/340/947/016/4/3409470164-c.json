They have constructed carillons since 1930 both nationally and internationally. This is why, in 1942, a bell tower with a carillon was built in the foundry\u2019s fa\u00e7ade. The foundry ceased to exist in 1980 but since 1987 the restored complex houses a bell-foundry <a href=\"http://www.klokkengieterijmuseum.nl/\">museum</a> where the history of bell casting is demonstrated.&#8221;\n<i>&ndash; <a href=\"http://www.carillon2008.nl/en/locaties.html\">Carillon2008</a></i></blockquote>The foundry was commissioned by Saint Martin's Episcopal Church in <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=St+Martin's+Episcopal+Church,++230+Lenox+Ave.,+NYC&amp;vps=1&amp;jsv=153e&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=31.564064,60.029297&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ei=vyzhSbFjhsg1mM-Zzg8&amp;sig2=M0NHJy4vzHGSTbmCUSS3-w&amp;cd=1&amp;cid=40805467,-73946586,359188036344091427&amp;li=lmd&amp;z=14&amp;t=m\">New York City</a> to build a carillon to celebrate the restoration of the church after a fire in 1939.

Played on a special keyboard, a carillon is one of music's grandest, rarest and most challenging percussive instruments, producing harmonies that, of course, are impossible on a single large bell. ...\n\n&#8220;That there is a carillon in Harlem at all is quite a feat. Unlike Riverside Church's carillon, which at 74 bells is the world's largest, St. Martin's 42-bell carillon was not a gift of John D. Rockefeller Jr. After the 1939 electrical fire left only the shell of the Romanesque Revival building, the 3,500-member congregation struggled to rebuild.\n\n&#8220;A parishioner, Arnold Rosey, originally from the West Indies, where church bells are common, gave $100 to the pastor, Mr. Johnson [<i>sic</i>, Reverend John H. Johnson], specifically for a fund to buy a bell. Word spread and parishioners &ndash; working-class men and women like laborers, hospital attendants and maids, most of them also from the West Indies &ndash; contributed $2,000. Mr. Johnson and others decided on a carillon from the renowned Royal Bell Casting Foundry, in Heiligerlee in the Netherlands.\n\n&#8220;In two years, the congregation raised the then extraordinary sum of $45,000, and the bells were installed in 1949. For many in the congregation, however, the real climax arrived when Queen Juliana of the Netherlands came to see the bells in 1952, thronged by more than 7,000 Harlem well-wishers. ...&#8221;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "29978018-3409470164-72157616641797264", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationaalarchief/3409470164/#comment72157617571263982", "realname": "", "path_alias": "it-is-aai", "author": "91271949@N00", "iconserver": "4", "datecreate": "1241221386", "_content": "Dus dit is niet in de VS, maar in Groningen...", "authorname": "it is aai!", "id": "29978018-3409470164-72157617571263982", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "3409470164"}, "flarchive:created": 1387761967}
