Launched on 21/3/1930, she was chartered to the Netherlands Government in 1948, who had established a line of emigrant ships to cope with the large scale level of emigration after the war. She made her first voyage from Rotterdam to Quebec in April 1948 and made a total of five round voyages to Quebec in 1948, plus four more in 1949. In July 1949 she made a single round voyage from Holland to New York. She was scrapped at Hong Kong in 1961 [North Atlantic Seaway by N.R.P.
