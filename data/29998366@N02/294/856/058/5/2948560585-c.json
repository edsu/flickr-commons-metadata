So it is most likely in The City somewhere, but I can't quite place that tube station, things've changed a lot down there.\n\n[\nEDIT: Ah. The raid I'm referring to was 29 Dec 1940. So I'm not sure this photo isn't misdated, for the reason that heavy raids on London ceased after May 1941, though there still were lighter attacks. I can't find any reference to a heavy raid on this date.\n\n'The last major attack on London was on 10 May [1941]: 515 bombers destroyed or damaged many important buildings, including the British Museum, the Houses of Parliament and St. James's Palace. The raid caused more casualties than any other: 1,364 killed and 1,616 seriously injured.[7] Six days later 111 bombers attacked Birmingham; this was the last major air raid on a British city for about a year and a half.'\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz</a>\n\n]", "authorname": "Fin Fahey", "id": "29978018-2948560585-72157608384985137", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationaalarchief/2948560585/#comment72157608518294719", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "90375069@N00", "iconserver": "6170", "datecreate": "1225402062", "_content": "Its Holborn isnt it Fin??", "authorname": "an essex guy", "id": "29978018-2948560585-72157608518294719", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationaalarchief/2948560585/#comment72157608531489429", "realname": "", "path_alias": "albedo", "author": "33917790@N00", "iconserver": "41", "datecreate": "1225442039", "_content": "I don't think so, Lud.
