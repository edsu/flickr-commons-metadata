The girl second on the right could be me. I am Dutch and looked like that in de 60's! The same unflattering hairstyle... Christmas was sooooo special in those days. Eventhough the food was not that extravagant as it is nowadays. Morning coffee was served with almond pastry (no fruit cake for us). And Christmas dinner consisted of vegetable soup, meat roll, boiled potatoes, boiled red pears and chocolate pudding with cream. We did not have much, but we were happy to celebrate such a lovely holiday. The candle in the fruitcake reminds me of the many burning candles that were a fairytale to a child's eye, but  made the temperature rise to unbearable levels, especially when wearing a period polyester party dress with matching but itching knitted tights. Christmas has always been my favourite holiday, also because my birthday is on the 22nd. So I went from one party to the next. It was magic. And the photograph took me back to this magic childhood for a while.
