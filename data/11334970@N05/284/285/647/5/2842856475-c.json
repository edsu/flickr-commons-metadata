As a boy in the 1950's I was fascinated by the lists of launches dating back to the 19th Century and the details of succesful rescues. The Flamborough lifeboat is now of a different type and stationed at South Landing and I understand a tractor and trailer are used in launching.", "authorname": "John D Hardy", "id": "11329630-2842856475-72157621865986599", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2842856475"}, "flarchive:created": 1387725014}
