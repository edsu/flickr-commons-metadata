Led Zep. \n\nBrian Jones, center.  Charlie Watts, tall one in the back.  Robert Plant on the left, &quot;standing in the shadows&quot;.  Phil Collins, front right.\n\nAll of this is on the lighter side, of course.  On the serious side, this photo is an anthropology and historical treasure, where caucasian-looking children are gathered in a traditionally asiatic environment of the Arctic North.  The Inuits are almost entirely depicted as Asiatic-looking.\n\nHowever, on the DNA side, there is the X-Haplotype anomaly, wherein ancient Northeastern European DNA strains appear in the Chippewa, Northern Canadian indigenous tribes.  I am on the amateur researcher arena of Chippewa are the Spirits of the Pekhats, Pequots, Picts, whose tribal members extended from the Scotland-Pictish areas, through the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Labrador, Nova Scotia, down to Virginia.  \n\nSo this picture is substantiated somewhat with DNA lineages found on both sides of the Atlantic, in addition to the alleged &quot;ad-mixtures&quot; which were supposedly post-Columbus diffusions.  (And how can anyone tell authentic post-Columbus with pre-Columbus)\n\nNet, net, this photo is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, a real significant discovery, most remarkable.  And they do look like a British rock group in the making.\n\nAstonishing.", "authorname": "EdZiomek", "id": "11329630-2842854847-72157627581987320", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2842854847"}, "flarchive:created": 1387725040}
