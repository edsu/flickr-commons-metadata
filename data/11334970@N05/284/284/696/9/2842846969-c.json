You geotagged this, and I went looking for the nearest geotagged commons image to me in Bristol. \n\nDo you know, I've lived in Bristol since 1994 and had never been to Burnham-on-Sea until two months ago. Then I spent an innordinate amount of time photographing <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/teepee1/sets/72157610906318660/\">a nine legged lighthouse on the foreshore.</a> This makes me want to go back and take a comparative photograph from this vantage point, to see how much/what/if anything has changed since 1903. It wouldn't be too difficult for me to do I don't think...\n\nDo you have any non-geotagged images of that lighthouse? It's been there for a long time to merit archive images I think....", "authorname": "Trapac", "id": "11329630-2842846969-72157612286000270", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmaritimemuseum/2842846969/#comment72157612237613467", "realname": "", "path_alias": "teepee1", "author": "84351393@N00", "iconserver": "13", "datecreate": "1231347701", "_content": "I'm back.
