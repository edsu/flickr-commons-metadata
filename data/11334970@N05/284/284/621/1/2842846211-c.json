There is a connection between the design of the Gravesend Baths and the Brighton Pavilion. The baths were rebuilt in 1836 and were designed by archtect Amon Henry Wilds. The domes and minarets echoed those Wilds used in teh design of his home in Brighton (the Western Pavilion) and the style was influenced by the Royal Pavilion in Brighton designed by John Nash.", "authorname": "SPD 2011", "id": "11329630-2842846211-72157626750216256", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmaritimemuseum/2842846211/#comment72157632406991942", "realname": "", "path_alias": "vercettisworld", "author": "14343849@N05", "iconserver": "8323", "datecreate": "1357074794", "_content": "Very fanciful...is it a place you can stay now?", "authorname": "GregHausM.D.", "id": "11329630-2842846211-72157632406991942", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "2842846211"}, "flarchive:created": 1387725090}
