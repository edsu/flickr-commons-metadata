Sadly, she was sunk in the Mediterranean Sea on November 25, 1941 by German submarine U-331.  U-331 struck her nearly simultaneously with three torpedoes, causing HMS Barham to rapidly roll over to port, and capsize.  Shortly thereafter, HMS Barham's magazines exploded catastrophically. HMS Barham's loss cost the lives of 861 men.  \n\nHMS Barham's sinking was caught on film, but graphic footage of her demise was kept from the public until the end of the war in 1945.  Here's a link to the British Pathe newsreel featuring the footage of HMS Barham's sinking:\n\nThe Sinking of HMS Barham\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HSY94QVIss\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HSY94QVIss</a>", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "11329630-4454160230-72157623747257202", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmaritimemuseum/4454160230/#comment72157623749267172", "realname": "Sam", "path_alias": "sam2cents", "author": "26033330@N00", "iconserver": "145", "datecreate": "1270155373", "_content": "I really like this one.", "authorname": "sam2cents", "id": "11329630-4454160230-72157623749267172", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmaritimemuseum/4454160230/#comment72157628842401217", "realname": "", "path_alias": "alimarante", "author": "41675580@N08", "iconserver": "6105", "datecreate": "1326400923", "_content": "If that black mog was aboard when the ship was lost I wonder if it survived.
