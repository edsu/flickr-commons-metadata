Almost looks as though the ship has been taken from a different (more distant) picture and photo-shopped into this one - it just looks too small!! The yachts in the foreground look to be moored just off Camper &amp; Nicholsons yard - I had a feeling that Victory was moored further down the harbour towards HMS Dolphin (but I might be wrong) so could this be a composite picture?", "authorname": "English eccentric", "id": "11329630-4793354800-72157627598855079", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmaritimemuseum/4793354800/#comment72157627602642677", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nationalmaritimemuseum", "author": "11334970@N05", "iconserver": "1393", "datecreate": "1316691182", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/englisheccentric] \n\nHi English eccentric\n\nThis ship is the Victory. She was anchored off the C &amp; N part of Portsmouth Harbour, as can be seen by the yachts in the foreground. The sailing warship off HMS Dolphin was HMS St. Vincent, moored off Haslar. She is dressed overall for the Coronation Fleet Review on 24 June 1911.\n\nVictory was not altered until she was placed in dry dock. Changing the bow back to the beakhead (from the Seppings round bow) was undertaken from 1922.\n\nThanks\n\nLucinda", "authorname": "National Maritime Museum", "id": "11329630-4793354800-72157627602642677", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "4793354800"}, "flarchive:created": 1387724184}
