After a re-fit at Surrey Docks in 1922 she headed back to Portugal, but a storm forced her to shelter at Falmouth Harbour, Cornwall. Here she was spotted by a mariner who had last seen her looking splendid under full sail in 1894. He decided she should be bought from her Portuguese owners and restored for the nation to enjoy. Renamed the 'Cutty Sark' once more, she spent some time at Greenhithe before coming to her current resting place in Greenwich in 1951.", "authorname": "National Maritime Museum", "id": "11329630-3525097875-72157620623705109", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmaritimemuseum/3525097875/#comment72157621750256883", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mando_gal", "author": "8110957@N08", "iconserver": "5446", "datecreate": "1248802927", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/534552@N23/\">ANYTHING GOES ENGLAND,VINTAGE PHOTOS,POSTCARDS,EPHEMERAetc...</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Mando Maniac", "id": "11329630-3525097875-72157621750256883", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmaritimemuseum/3525097875/#comment72157622198166908", "realname": "Gert van Duinen", "path_alias": "cresk", "author": "89809226@N00", "iconserver": "5300", "datecreate": "1251747272", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/814768@N20/\">Nautical Art</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Gert van Duinen", "id": "11329630-3525097875-72157622198166908", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "3525097875"}, "flarchive:created": 1387724836}
