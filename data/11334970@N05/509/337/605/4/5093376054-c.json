Also, the breach lines are a single rope spliced at each end onto an eye, therefore, these guns could not be run out easily.  The gun ports are also not proper ones \u2013 they have no lids to keep the water out.\n\nThe guns are larger than would be expected for signal guns (usually 3 pounders).\n\nHowever, we are fairly certain that it is Great Eastern, as it does show the cable laying equipment.\n\nWe would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThanks\n\nLucinda", "authorname": "National Maritime Museum", "id": "11329630-5093376054-72157629418057797", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "5093376054"}, "flarchive:created": 1387724030}
