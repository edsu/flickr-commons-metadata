According to the Museum's Conservation Department, conservation is not about creating a \u201cwhole new\u201d anything. Any treatment that is undertaken ensures the stability of the picture whilst using materials that are readily reversible and appropriate for conservation purposes. \n\nIn a practical sense this means that nothing original will be removed from the painting and anything that is added in terms of retouching or varnish will remain reversible.", "authorname": "National Maritime Museum", "id": "11329630-2839522578-72157608810604209", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmaritimemuseum/2839522578/#comment72157608808602962", "realname": "Keith Last", "path_alias": "kjlast", "author": "53555705@N00", "iconserver": "7439", "datecreate": "1226321800", "_content": "Well thank you for getting back to me and leaving such an interesting answer, its good to know that any work done now can at some later date be taken away again. I should hate to think that in a 100 or so years time these works of art would have basically had a whole new face, but pleased to hear this is not in fact the case.\nThanks,\nkeith", "authorname": "kjlast", "id": "11329630-2839522578-72157608808602962", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmaritimemuseum/2839522578/#comment72157608818671157", "realname": "", "path_alias": "andrexgomex", "author": "24323685@N02", "iconserver": "2731", "datecreate": "1226343129", "_content": "hola . admiro de manera sobre natural la labor  de la artista ,, que quedo anodado con su talento   :)!", "authorname": "andresmauricio,.,", "id": "11329630-2839522578-72157608818671157", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmaritimemuseum/2839522578/#comment72157609635418585", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pennypisswater", "author": "12959867@N00", "iconserver": "107", "datecreate": "1227308720", "_content": "I'm jealous.
