Those two windows above would have been our living room. Very cold, and rarely used except for events like Christmas. They are very tall, narrow buildings with two rooms on each floor and a basement with spooky passageways. I found an old air raid helmet and gas mask in ours. Our basement was used for my Dad's darkroom for the Studio, and a workshop with his little printing press, where he also did business cards and flyers for people.
