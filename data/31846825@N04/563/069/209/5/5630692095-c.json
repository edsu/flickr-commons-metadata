These were probably added to express the speed of the new train. Even in the late thirties planes already were huge competitors for trains.\n\nThe engine must be an EMD E3 from 1939.\n\nI found this on the internet:\n\nThe inauguration of the Henry M. Flagler and The Champion in December of 1939  is frequently recognized as the beginning of dieselization on the Florida East Coast. Power chosen for each of the six car trains was EMC's early, slant-nose 2000 horsepower E3 units, numbered 1001 and 1002. A third unit, a new E6, was built in December of 1940 and was assigned to The Champion between Jacksonville and Miami.\nIn February of 1942, the FEC received an additional A-B-A set of 2000 horsepower E6 locomotives (1004-1051-1005) from Electro-Motive for service on a joint FEC-ACL train, The Florida Special. Both A-units wore the same red, yellow and silver paint as applied to the E3s, but without the silver ends that was designed to blend in with the stainless steel train that followed.", "authorname": "cklx", "id": "31814686-5630692095-72157626559680372", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/floridamemory/5630692095/#comment72157626579712610", "realname": "carlosbezz", "path_alias": "artlandstudio", "author": "22694125@N02", "iconserver": "7427", "datecreate": "1303785810", "_content": "Congratulations!\nThis is a wonderful shot!\nYou are invited to post it to: \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/artland/\"> <img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3447/3789880871_7381296df7_m.jpg \" /></a>\n<b> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/artland/\">artland </a></b>", "authorname": "artland", "id": "31814686-5630692095-72157626579712610", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/floridamemory/5630692095/#comment72157626455848877", "realname": "grahamH", "path_alias": "grahamh_pix", "author": "11299198@N07", "iconserver": "2112", "datecreate": "1303795133", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/cklx] So you are suggesting that the colourised photo is from pre US involvement in WWII eg 1939 like the adjacent picture, rather than the later date given by Florida Library?
