The job of the dark-suited soldier at the extreme right was to keep the sun beam reflected by the dual 4.5 inch square mirrors on his tripod in constant alignment on the target as the sun moved, using vernier elevation and azimuth screws. The job of the light-suited soldier in the middle was to open and close the shutter flap on his tripod to produce the dots and dashes of the code.\n\nA diagram showing this heliograph (albeit in single-mirror mode), taken from [1], is here\n(click on the thumbnail to magnify), and see [1] for the dual-mirror mode diagram.\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/signalmirror/8325396278/]\n\nAn 1893 photograph of this type of heliograph (albeit in single-mirror mode), taken from [2], is here (click on the thumbnail to magnify)\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/signalmirror/8324352335/]\nTo learn more about heliographs, you can read [1] and [2], as well as this Wikipedia article:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliograph\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliograph</a>\n\nYou can also see this Flickr gallery (click on the thumbnail):\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/signalmirror/galleries/72157630246445306/]\n\nand this set (click on the thumbnail) : (Historical Photographs of American Heliographs)\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/signalmirror/sets/72157631040759962/]\n\n[ 1 ]  Annual Report of the Chief Signal Officer of the Army to the\nSecretary of War for the Year 1888, Government Printing Office, 1889\nThe new standard heliograph is discussed in Appendix I, pp. 42-47, \nand depicted on page 46, here:\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=E2nPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=heliograph\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=E2nPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq...</a>\n\n[2] &quot;The Heliograph&quot;, The Compass, Vol. II, No. 11, June 1, 1893, page 161\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=tX0SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA161\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=tX0SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA161</a>", "authorname": "signal mirror", "id": "31814686-3465709162-72157632378993825", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/floridamemory/3465709162/#comment72157632462428658", "realname": "Florida Memory", "path_alias": "floridamemory", "author": "31846825@N04", "iconserver": "2854", "datecreate": "1357563989", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/signalmirror] Thanks for the great information!", "authorname": "State Library and Archives of Florida", "id": "31814686-3465709162-72157632462428658", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3465709162"}, "flarchive:created": 1387666534}
