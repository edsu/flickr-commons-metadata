She was a pioneer in military health, a genius of public relations, and the world\u2019s founder of systems for identifying the missing and the dead. \n\nIn June, 1995, the US Postal Service honored Clara with a 32\u00a2 stamp as part of the <i>American Civil War Classic Collection</i>. First Day of Issue ceremonies were held on June 29, 1995, in front of the Cyclorama Center at the Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania. (Scott 2975c).\n\nI'm struck by the remarkable similarity of the likeness in the stamp to that of the Mathew Brady portrait of Clara Barton <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/4190953656/\">in the National Archives on the Commons</a>, however I've not found anything to indicate Brady's portrait was the basis for the stamp.\n\nClara Barton was also honored with a 3&cent; commemorative stamp in September, 1948, as the founder of the American Red Cross in 1881. First Day ceremonies were held on September 7, 1948, in Clara's hometown of Oxford, Massachusetts.
