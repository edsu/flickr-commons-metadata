What the early settlers did to the natives they encountered was no different and the descendants of those settlers have never really amended their actions in any way, shape or form. Except perhaps in the form of an hereditary sense of guilt which when rearing it's ugly head in the collective American psyche, is forced deep back inside by the blinding lights of consumerism.
