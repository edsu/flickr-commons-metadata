Steele and Reverend Daniel Speed for operating a carpool service without a license. Steele and Speed organized the carpool in order to provide transportation for African-Americans during the Tallahassee Bus Boycott. On October 21, Steele, Speed, and 19 others were convicted by Tallahassee judge John A. Rudd of operating an illegal transportation business and fined $11,000. In response, Steele traveled the country to raise money to pay the fines. Despite resistance by police and city officials, the boycott ultimately succeeded in desegregating public buses in Tallahassee.", "authorname": "State Library and Archives of Florida", "id": "31814686-9895592606-72157635798973404", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "9895592606"}, "flarchive:created": 1387663165}
