Excellent B &amp; W photos and excellent description of the photos.  I enjoy photos of people iin their natural habitat, cloting, etc.  Always enjoy older school childred class photos - imagint the mothers worked hard to get their children theier best for the photos.  \n\nIn this photo, I believe the vehicle partially shown is a Mercury, due to the double moldings on side of front fender.
