The home, at one time seized for back taxes by a carpet-bagging tax collector of Calhoun County,  was sold to the Leonard brothers of Calhoun County, then to Neal Land and Timber Company. In the early 1930s (please correct the circa date), Neal Land and Timber Company donated it to the State of Florida. The view is actually of the back of the house (note on the right hand side where the walkway to the kitchen was removed) and the view you first see when walking up to the house at Torreya State Park. Notice all the bricks stacked by this area. Those are from the foundation of the kitchen. The giant old oak tree (there used to be two, one on either side of the house) remains at Ocheesee Landing, but the elements and pavement that goes right up to its base have taken their toll. It was once listed in the Big Tree directory. Torreya State Park remains one of the Panhandle's biggest kept secrets. It is a place where I go periodically to get back on track with my senses.", "authorname": "gatorfriendly", "id": "31814686-3248134804-72157622239489792", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/floridamemory/3248134804/#comment72157622239616286", "realname": "", "path_alias": "blackdoll", "author": "20361422@N00", "iconserver": "111", "datecreate": "1252075711", "_content": "Oh wow thank you so much gatorfriendly.
