She was elected to the National Academy of Arts and Letters.&quot;<i><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/abaesel/2532661904/\">[1]</a></i>\n\n&quot;In 1928, the Rawlingses purchased a 72 acre orange grove near Hawthorne, Florida, in a hamlet named Cross Creek for its location between Orange Lake and Lochloosa Lake. She brought the place to international fame through her writing. She was fascinated with the remote wilderness and the lives of Cross Creek residents, her Cracker neighbors (descendants of pioneer settlers), and felt a profound and transforming connection to the region and the land. Wary at first, the local residents soon warmed to her and opened up their lives and experiences to her. Marjorie filled several notebooks with descriptions of the animals, plants, Southern dialect, and recipes and used these descriptions in her writings.&quot;<i>&mdash;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Kinnan_Rawlings\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a></i>\n&nbsp;\nIn 2008, the US Postal Service <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/13086494@N02/2294353201/\">unveiled</a> a\nstamp bearing Rawlings' image, in her honor, \nat her Cross Creek home.
