He began his career in movies as a projectionist at a theater in Milledgeville, Georgia, where he spent much of his childhood. Oliver &quot;Babe&quot; Hardy moved to Jacksonville in 1913 and made 50 short one-reeler films for Lubin Studios. After moving to New York, he returned to Jacksonville around 1915 and appeared in more than 60 comedies for the Vim Comedy Company and the King Bee studios, where he worked with Charlie Chaplin imitator Billy West and comedic actress Ethel Burton Palmer. Hardy followed the King Bee studio to New Jersey and then to Hollywood, where he would  begin his celebrated partnership with Stan Laurel in 1921.\n\n<strong>General note:</strong> Ethel Burton (Palmer) was a popular comedic actress who made her debut with Vitagraph Pictures in 1915. She co-starred in several Billy West comedies (a popular Charlie Chaplin imitator), and was married to director Arvid Gillstrom, a Swedish-born filmmaker who directed many of the West comedies. Burton did little acting after the 1910s. Most of the films she made in Florida were with the Vim Comedy Company.\n\n<strong>General note:</strong> L-R: Pearl Bailey, Budd Ross, &quot;Babe&quot; Oliver Hardy and Ethel Burton. \n\n<strong>Repository:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.floridamemory.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">State Library and Archives of Florida</a>, 500 S.
