The bloom lasts a mere 2-3 weeks in April and May. Pure tupelo honey is light amber in color; some note a green cast. It has a pear-like and hoppy aroma and a coveted flavor that fans describe as mild, delicate, buttery, floral, like cotton candy and like rosewater.\n\nAnyone else have any more information?", "authorname": "State Library and Archives of Florida", "id": "31814686-3368167754-72157615624564666", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3368167754"}, "flarchive:created": 1387666663}
