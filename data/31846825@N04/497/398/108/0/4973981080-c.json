We used to love to go to his island and just listen to him talk about different things. I remember he was such a gentelman to the ladies. His dog,s name was &quot;Boogem&quot;. What a dog. Roy built a special ramp up high to a look out tower so Boogem could alert him when company was arriving. He was a very intelligent man. \nMy step father, Frank Braman, would take us kids out to his island every couple of months just so we could visit Roy and Boogemand play on the island.. What good times that was. I believe some where around 1955, 56, 57. Not real sure about that.", "authorname": "pissupurass", "id": "31814686-4973981080-72157632763061321", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4973981080"}, "flarchive:created": 1387665718}
