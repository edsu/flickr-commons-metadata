Three or four miles further on they were told that there was another deep river not far away which surpassed all the others in size and beauty. When they reached it they found it so magnificent and great a stream that they called it Port Royal. Here they lowered the sail and dropped anchor at ten fathoms. The commander of the expedition and the soldiers that went ashore with him found it a very pleasant place, well wooded with oak, cedar and other types of tree. As they walked in the forest they saw turkeys flying and stags wandering. The mouth of this river is three miles wide and splits into two arms, one towards the west and the other to the north. This latter (according to the opinion of some) penetrates deep into the interior towards the river Jordan. The other, as has been observed, throws itself westwards into the sea. Midway between the two branches is an island whose point faces the mouth of the river. The French re-embarked and took the northern branch in order to see what advantages it might have. After about twelve miles, they saw a company of Indians who, at the sight of the boats, fled, leaving behind a wolf's whelp which they were in the middle of eating. For this reason they called the place Wolf's Point. Sailing further, they came across another branch of the river, which came from the east. The commander decided to leave the main stream and continue along this other arm.&quot;", "authorname": "State Library and Archives of Florida", "id": "31814686-11084467864-72157638113295454", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "11084467864"}, "flarchive:created": 1387662890}
