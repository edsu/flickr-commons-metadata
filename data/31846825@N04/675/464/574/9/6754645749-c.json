I believe his son Harry served as Superintendent of Schools for Wakulla County for a little while.  In this picture, he is wearing his civil war uniform and from what I understand he was also buried in it.  There are still quite a few family members living in the Wakulla County area, including myself, my parents, and my siblings and their families.", "authorname": "wakulla-lady", "id": "31814686-6754645749-72157629025296673", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/floridamemory/6754645749/#comment72157629025792011", "realname": "Florida Memory", "path_alias": "floridamemory", "author": "31846825@N04", "iconserver": "2854", "datecreate": "1327500314", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/75150969@N03] Thank you for the additional information.

He was born in Wakulla County, but moved to central Florida where he was a businessman.  I'm not sure what he did exactly, but my father thinks he may have been involved in real estate and orange groves.  His brother, Pap, was the Superintendent of Schools in Wakulla County.  \n\nHarry and his father (Captain Jack Pearce from photo) are now buried side-by-side in the Hilliardville Cemetery, which is now owned by my father, Arthur Randolph Pearce, III and his cousin, Jack Pearce.  Hilliardville Cemetery is located just across the Leon County/Wakulla County line in Wakulla County (off Springhill Road, just before it meets Bloxham Cutoff, or Hwy. 267) on Guy Strickland Road.  My father thinks the photo may have been taken at Captain Jack's house, which is still standing on Guy Strickland Road (just a couple hundred yards down the road from the Hilliardville Cemetery) in Wakulla County.", "authorname": "wakulla-lady", "id": "31814686-6754645749-72157629027172583", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/floridamemory/6754645749/#comment72157629029930409", "realname": "Florida Memory", "path_alias": "floridamemory", "author": "31846825@N04", "iconserver": "2854", "datecreate": "1327521048", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/75150969@N03] Thanks again for the information.
