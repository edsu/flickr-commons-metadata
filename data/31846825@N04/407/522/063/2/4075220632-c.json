The Lab\u2019s aim is to create a very personal online-map with special places of our contributors worldwide to share. (That\u2019s why they should be easy accessible!) \nIt would be great if you could contribute your special place, because your style would really fit to us.\n\nHere is all the info you need - it\u2019s very easy: <a href=\"http://www.worldidentitylab.net/project/current/nowhere-now-here/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.worldidentitylab.net/project/current/nowhere-now-here/</a>\nIf you have any questions you can write me a mail: florian.greimel@worldidentitylab.net\n\nThanks! Keep on shooting :)\nFlorian and the World Identity Lab Team", "authorname": "worldidentitylab", "id": "31814686-4075220632-72157624892163537", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4075220632"}, "flarchive:created": 1387666103}
