Tucker was postmistress in the tiny hamlet of Christmas, Florida, for 42 years from 1932 until her retirement on December 31, 1974.  She was a daughter-in-law of the former Postmasters, Drew and Lizzie Tucker. &nbsp;  Juanita, who was an artist and a poet, created a design of a lighted Christmas tree that would be stamped on mail sent from her post office.\n\nEach year thousands of letters came for postmarking and she lovingly stamped each with the small green Christmas tree cachet and the legend &quot;Glory to God in the Highest.&quot; But then, in 1949 (after 15 years) the Post Office Department informed her coldly that as a postal employee, she was not allowed by regulations to place &quot;personal or unofficial endorsements&quot; upon mail. Mrs. Tucker was crestfallen.\n\nThe resulting brouhaha created national attention and Senator Spessard L. Holland (D-FL) interceded with US Postmaster Jesse M. Donaldson to allow Mrs. Tucker to continue the use of the rubber stamp. \n\n&nbsp;\n<b>&quot;Special Cache for Juanita Tucker's last Christmas as Postmaster, 1974&quot;</b>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pixelwrangler/8288840690/\" title=\"Special Cache for Juanita Tucker's last Christmas as Postmaster, 1974 (Collection of Juanita Tucker)\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8201/8288840690_c04ba3b20b.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"293\" alt=\"Special Cache for Juanita Tucker's last Christmas as Postmaster, 1974 (Collection of Juanita Tucker)\" /></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (Collection of Juanita Tucker)\n\nIn 1969, and again in 1995, the US Postal Service honored Christmas, Florida as the site of the First Day Issue of the Christmas stamp for that year. 1969 featured the 6&cent; <i>Christmas Winter Sunday</i> (<a href=\"http://www.mysticstamp.com/viewProducts.asp?sku=1384\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scott 1384</a>), and in 1995 the 32&cent; <i>Midnight Angel</i> (<a href=\"http://www.mysticstamp.com/viewProducts.asp?sku=3012\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scott 3012</a>).\n\n&nbsp;\n<b>&quot;First Day Issue from Christmas, Florida, 1995&quot;</b>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pixelwrangler/8287763405/\" title=\"First Day Issue from Christmas, Florida, 1995  (Collection of Joan Templeton) \"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8074/8287763405_55c079a9fe.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"287\" alt=\"First Day Issue from Christmas, Florida, 1995  (Collection of Joan Templeton)\" /></a>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Collection of Joan Templeton)\n\nWhen a new, modern post office was built in Christmas, the town's historic post office was preserved as a gift shop.\n\nJuanita Tucker died in 2008 at the age of 101.
