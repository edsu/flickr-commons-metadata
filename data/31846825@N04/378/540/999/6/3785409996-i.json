That was captured by the Spanish during the American Revolution, who renamed it San Carlos de Barrancas (which was re-built in 1797 and again in 1817). The word barrancas means &quot;bluff&quot; in Spanish. \n\nFrom 1839-1844, the United States built the current Fort Barrancas on the same site (including some of the orginal still standing). The fort was utilized during the Civil War, Spanish-American War, and the Second World War. Galleries are located below the top, or parade level of the fort. These were built to provide firing areas for infantry to defend the ditch surrounding the fort. In 1966, Fort Barrancas was listed on the National Park Service's Gulf Islands National Seashore. And in 1980, it was restored and was opened to the public as a National Landmark. \n\n<strong>Repository:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.floridamemory.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">State Library and Archives of Florida</a>, 500 S.
