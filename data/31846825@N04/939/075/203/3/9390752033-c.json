As the attraction grew, the river was dredged for glass bottom boat tours; and waterfalls were built on piles of phosphate tailings. A zoo, rodeo, gift shops and a monorail with leaf-shaped gondolas were added. In the mid-1970s, when larger theme parks lured the tourists away, Rainbow Springs was closed. In the mid-1990s, it reopened as a state park. In 1972, the U.S. Department of the Interior designated Rainbow River as a National Natural Landmark. It is also an aquatic preserve and an Outstanding Florida Water.&quot;\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "31814686-9390752033-72157634839879455", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/floridamemory/9390752033/#comment72157634839969633", "realname": "Florida Memory", "path_alias": "floridamemory", "author": "31846825@N04", "iconserver": "2854", "datecreate": "1375105432", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pixelwrangler] Thanks Pixel!
