As authors of a dubious book on Scottish tartans and clan dress, the Vestiarium Scoticum, they are the source of some current tartan traditions.\n\nJohn and Charles were born in Wales in the last decade of the 18th century. Later they would claim to have discovered in 1811 that they were descended from the Stuart kings, and on their 1871 census entry they gave Versailles as their birthplace. They moved to live in Scotland and changed their Allen surname to the more Scottish spelling Allan, then to Hay Allan, and Hay. Their father John Carter Allen had Hay ancestry, and was said to have been related to the Earl of Erroll.&quot;</i>\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sobieski_Stuart\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sobieski_Stuart</a></blockquote>\nthis fellow has an incredible life story!\n\nhe and his brother learned Gaelic, hobnobbed with Scottish nobility, and published an \u201cinventive\u201d book on the history of Highland dress.
