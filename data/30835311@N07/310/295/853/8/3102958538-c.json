When I was a boy in the nearby seaside/fishing town of Musselburgh in the 1950's/60's, there were still old fishwives who went around the town dressed like this as their daily dress.  A part of Musselburgh called Fisherrow was the fishing district, near the harbour.\n\nThe fishwives' dress included a black knitted shawl and a blue/white striped skirt. I can't remember the blouse arrangement !
