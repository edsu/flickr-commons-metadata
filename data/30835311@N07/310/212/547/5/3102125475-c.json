Instead, his coatee is double-breasted and plain fronted. Also note the length of his kilt - finishing just above the knee, the the tops of his hose, which are part-way up his shin. Also, they don't wear white spats in this photo, as it was a less-dressy item.\n\nAls note the crossbelts on the middle soldier. Around 1852, the British Army started wearing the newer design with one crossbelt for the ammo cartouche and percussion caps and a waistbelt for the expense pouch and bayonet.", "authorname": "l_gow2006", "id": "30813981-3102125475-72157613368916993", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalgalleries/3102125475/#comment72157616874839577", "realname": "Sunny Brook", "path_alias": "sunnybrook100", "author": "8974807@N02", "iconserver": "1130", "datecreate": "1240025326", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1056855@N21/\">Vintage Background People</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "sunnybrook100", "id": "30813981-3102125475-72157616874839577", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "3102125475"}}
