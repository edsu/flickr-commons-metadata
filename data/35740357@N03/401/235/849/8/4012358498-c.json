If you drive along I-70 just south of Manhattan, Kansas, there is almost 3500 hectares of tallgrass prairie known as the Konza Prairie.  KSU does do research on this land, but it is left to flourish in all it's natural beauty.  If you take exit 313 north to Manhattan off of I-70 there is a lookout spot for travelers.  You can see for miles, and each season shows a different beauty on the prairie.", "authorname": "boofsmom", "id": "35717303-4012358498-72157637425914713", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4012358498"}, "flarchive:created": 1387667652}
