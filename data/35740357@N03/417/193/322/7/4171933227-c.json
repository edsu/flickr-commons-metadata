Most of these were digitized in the late 1990s.  Photographs and documents that have been digitized more recently are almost always available in the catalog at a higher resolution (300 dpi).  In those cases, we always make the higher resolution version available here on Flickr, too.\n\nWe would love to make higher resolution versions (of the lower resolution copies) available some time in the future.\n\nThanks again,\nJill (U.S. National Archives)", "authorname": "The U.S. National Archives", "id": "35717303-4171933227-72157623224815467", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/4171933227/#comment72157623225202575", "realname": "Eric Hunt", "path_alias": "ericinsf", "author": "39312862@N00", "iconserver": "7340", "datecreate": "1265294462", "_content": "Jill - yup, that's what I've noticed and I really REALLY am excited you're making the high resolution available.
