My parents owned The Weather Vane until my brother, sister, and I sold it after our mother, June Lesch, died. The window above the store was my father's Harbormaster office after my brother moved out. My father Gene C. &quot;Shorty&quot; Lesch had an excellent view from the upstairs window of Motif # 1 and T-Wharf. It was great place to watch the people go by when I was little. My mother used the office after my father died as a &quot;sun room&quot; as it faced South East.  Another person rented the gift shop selling fine clothing and sweaters. This woman lost her husband on 9/11 aboard United Airlines Flight 175.", "authorname": "sbl1952", "id": "35717303-3930866277-72157628845282547", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/3930866277/#comment72157635325578679", "realname": "katherine smith", "path_alias": null, "author": "101122024@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1378049014", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/84619552@N00] \nI have a wonderful mid-century (1967) -modern pewter bowl made, signed and dated by your father.
