The portrait of the Mochida family wearing identification tags around their necks made the pages of Newsweek magazine and other outlets, and helped expose a dark moment in American history.\n....\nMiyuki Hirano of Sparks, Nev., another one of the surviving Mochida siblings, remembers seeing her face on that book's cover.  \n\nBut while they occasionally see reminders of their youth in print, it took many years for Mochida family members to be able to talk frankly about what happened to them, said Kayoko Ikuma, 69, of San Mateo, who was 4 when Lange took her photo.  \n\nIkuma said witnessing the treatment of America's Muslim population has made her try to share her experience more.\n\nTheir parents avoided discussing the internment after the war.  Their father, who had owned a successful flower-growing business in unincorporated Alameda County, returned from the camps unhappy, spent the rest of his life in domestic labor and took to drinking.\n\nThe Lange photographs, and the Mochida children's more vivid memories of years spent in the Utah camp, is all they have left from that time.\n</blockquote>", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "35717303-3679508964-72157621469574577", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/3679508964/#comment72157621682089965", "realname": "", "path_alias": "usnationalarchives", "author": "35740357@N03", "iconserver": "8547", "datecreate": "1248442145", "_content": "Pennylrichardsca, thanks for letting us know about this fascinating article about the Mochida family.
