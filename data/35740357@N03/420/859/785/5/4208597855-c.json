She was the first woman to serve as an Army surgeon. \n\nIn 1865, on the recommendation of General Sherman, Walker was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. However, 51 years later, new criteria for receiving the medal disqualified her. Walker refused to return the medal and wore it every day until her death in 1919. &nbsp;In 1977, an order was signed by the Secretary of the Army to reinstate her award. She is the only woman to ever be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nFirst Day of Issue ceremonies were held in her hometown of Oswego, New York on June 10, 1982.
