Office of Senate Curator.(? - )\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> At the end of World War I and in the years following, the Congress and the American people felt threatened as Bolshevism appeared to gain popularity throughout war-ravaged Europe and even in America. To control the flow of Bolshevists into the United States, the House passed a bill to extend wartime passport regulations for a year after peace was declared, but the Senate had not yet taken up the bill. Cartoonist Clifford Berryman uses his familiar Uncle Sam to note that the bill was &quot;a long step in the RIGHT direction&quot;. Berryman's teddy bear is seen pulling up the welcome mat as a somewhat wild-haired, bearded man carrying rolls of paper entitled &quot;Red propaganda&quot; and &quot;Bolshevism&quot; under his arm approaches.\n\n<strong>Production Date:</strong> 10/19/1919\n\n<strong>Persistent URL:</strong>  <a href=\"http://research.archives.gov/description/6011588\" rel=\"nofollow\">research.archives.gov/description/6011588</a>\n\n<strong>Repository: </strong> National Archives at College Park - Still Pictures (RD-DC-S)\n\nFor information about ordering reproductions of photographs held by the Still Picture Unit, visit: <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/research/order/still-pictures.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.archives.gov/research/order/still-pictures.html</a>\n\nReproductions may be ordered via an independent vendor.
