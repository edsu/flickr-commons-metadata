Yes, indeed. This is the famous St. Paul's Chapel at the corner of Park Row and Broadway, near Ground Zero, in lower Manhattan. The Trinity Church reference comes from the original caption given by photographer Wil Blanche in 1973. We will make note of the misidentification.\n\nJerry (U.S. National Archives)", "authorname": "The U.S. National Archives", "id": "35717303-3953391026-72157624949022030", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/3953391026/#comment72157624827256557", "realname": "Truskeptic", "path_alias": "truskeptic", "author": "46402775@N07", "iconserver": "7385", "datecreate": "1284431211", "_content": "For Lizzie~Belle ...\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/truskeptic/4988212471/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4104/4988212471_c00e7a300a_z.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" alt=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" /></a>\n\nI will not be entering this quick snap (taken in whatever light was available at 8.45 this morning) into any competitions! It does, however, approximate to the view above (taken from Park Row). The original was probably taken from further back with a longer lens. Scaffolding and parked cars prohibited my replicating this today. Although there are many pedestrians, (Broadway crosses Park Row at the traffic lights and hundreds of NJ/NY commuters cross this junction each day) traffic-wise,  the roads appear much quieter than they are most of the time in reality - I suspect the same may be true of the original (does anyone remember that far back)?\n\nMost obviously, the towers are missing and the trees in St. Paul's Chapel churchyard have grown significantly. The 'new' black building behind the church is the Millennium Hilton Hotel, (a survivor of 9/11 with only slight damage). In the far distance, and now around 30 floors high, is the steelwork and core of WTC Tower #1 construction - still referred to by most as the 'Freedom Tower'. The footprint of the new tower #1 is located a few yards to the Northwest of where the former North Tower stood and is significantly larger than the originals.", "authorname": "truskeptic", "id": "35717303-3953391026-72157624827256557", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/3953391026/#comment72157625004801903", "realname": "jack", "path_alias": null, "author": "54123466@N04", "iconserver": "4148", "datecreate": "1286671892", "_content": "wow", "authorname": "starrmanstarr1", "id": "35717303-3953391026-72157625004801903", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/3953391026/#comment72157627407634185", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66852274@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1314474626", "_content": "Here's one that I found is the same view on the day of the catastrophe. \n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/66852274@N03/6086196357/in/photostream]", "authorname": "NCIndia", "id": "35717303-3953391026-72157627407634185", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3953391026"}, "flarchive:created": 1387669256}
