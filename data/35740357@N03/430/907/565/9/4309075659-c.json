But when there is evidence that the caption is inaccurate, the archivists will typically include a note in the description in our online catalog (the Archival Research Catalog, or ARC for short <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/research/arc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.archives.gov/research/arc/</a> ).  We will pass the information you're sharing with us and everyone here on Flickr along to the still picture archivists.\n\nThanks again,\nJill (U.S. National Archives)", "authorname": "The U.S. National Archives", "id": "35717303-4309075659-72157623461190828", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "4309075659"}, "flarchive:created": 1387645939}
