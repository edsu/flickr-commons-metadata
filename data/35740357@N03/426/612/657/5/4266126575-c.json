Brigadier General John Rawlins only began experiencing symptoms of his consumption during the Chattanooga Campaign in November of 1863, but outward appearances looked normal throughout most of the war.  It wasn't until the war had approached its final year that perhaps he began to show outward signs of the consumption.  I think this photograph had to have been taken in the fall of 1865 at the earliest.", "authorname": "dmoran1962", "id": "35717303-4266126575-72157634238121640", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4266126575"}, "flarchive:created": 1387663936}
