I'm not an expert in World War I aircraft, but I did a little research, and I believe &quot;nurse balloons&quot; were hydrogen filled balloons that were tethered to the ground for observation purposes.  I've been asking a few experts around here at the National Archives, and when I have more information I'll let you know.  In the meantime, does anyone else out there know what exactly nurse balloons were used for in World War I?  Let us know!\n\nMary\nU.S. National Archives", "authorname": "The U.S. National Archives", "id": "35717303-5505934093-72157626248864925", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/5505934093/#comment72157626261846231", "realname": "", "path_alias": "usnationalarchives", "author": "35740357@N03", "iconserver": "8547", "datecreate": "1301493308", "_content": "Here's an update!  I heard from Mitch Yockelson, an investigative archivist here at the National Archives, and he pointed me to a source about balloons in World War I.  According to Eileen LeBow in <i>A Grandstand Seat: The American Balloon Service in World War I</i>, nurse balloons were used to carry extra gas for inflating other balloons.  In a sense, they acted as a &quot;nurse&quot; to help other balloons (presumably the patients).  Thanks Mitch for clarifying that for us!\n\nMary\nU.S. National Archives", "authorname": "The U.S. National Archives", "id": "35717303-5505934093-72157626261846231", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/5505934093/#comment72157636279822865", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "24241972@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1381134331", "_content": "Great info, thanks to all.", "authorname": "ika_ika_ika", "id": "35717303-5505934093-72157636279822865", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5505934093"}, "flarchive:created": 1387644460}
