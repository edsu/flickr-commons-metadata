I worked there in 1973.  We made Smith Ski Goggles.  I had to polish 570 lenses a day in order to avoid getting yelled at.  Not surprisingly, 570 lenses happened to be the bare minimum that anyone could polish during a day's shift, so I never earned a penny in piecework.  I learned that to polish 570 lenses, you couldn't really do a good job, but the number was more important than the quality.   Most of the employees went outside during our 15-minute breaks so they could smoke and thereby increase their chances of contracting strange cancers.  On my breaks, I read, making it through The Gulag Archipelago, Lash's biographies of Eleanor and Franklin, and the Federalist Papers.  I lasted 6 months, then I went to college.  Later, they tried striking for better conditions, and the plant was shut down.", "authorname": "judylcrook", "id": "35717303-3815030803-72157629927486908", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3815030803"}, "flarchive:created": 1387671693}
