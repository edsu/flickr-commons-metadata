Dead deer and elk were strapped all over vehicles, and drive through town.  I'm not sure why i don't see that now--maybe people are more considerate, maybe they drive down the bypass instead of through town, or maybe it's against the law.  In about 1971, my brother took photographs of dead deer and posted them in an anti-hunting poster at Rifle High School.  This was not appreciated by our classmates.  Of course, all of our ancestors and most of our relatives were hunters.  My grandparents guided hunters near Rifle.  Here are a couple of photos of them.  Yuck.
