Arlington and Alexandria are so close together on the Potomac it would be hard to determine exactly where the photo was taken and the location of the sign. Perhaps others can weigh in with thoughts and opinions.\n\nAlso, we corrected the tagging restrictions on this photo set and you should now be able to add tags.\n\nJerry (U.S. National Archives)", "authorname": "The U.S. National Archives", "id": "35717303-3769843656-72157622565815179", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "3769843656"}, "flarchive:created": 1387672449}
