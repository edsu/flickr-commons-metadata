The aircraft would make a successful emergency landing at Kahului Airport (OGG / PHOG) on Maui.  \n\nSadly, Clarabelle &quot;C.B.&quot; Lansing, an Aloha flight attendant, would lose her life as she was reportedly blown out of the aircraft as its upper fuselage tore away over the Pacific Ocean.  While many of the passengers aboard would suffer injury, Ms. Lansing would represent the sole fatality.\n\nThe failure of the aircraft's cabin would be attributed to metal fatigue caused by years of service flying relatively short hops between the Hawaiian islands, with frequent compression and decompression cycles in a salt air coastal environment.\n\nAs a result of Aloha Flight 243, more stringent inspection standards were implemented for older airliners and an untold number of lives have been saved.\n\nHere's a photo of the aircraft in the immediate aftermath of the incident:\n<img src=\"http://theticket-atlanta.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Aloha243.jpg\" />", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "35717303-7153599951-72157630471847304", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "7153599951"}, "flarchive:created": 1387640001}
