Having gained his freedom as a young man, he devoted his life to the cause of human freedom and equality. In 1889 President Benjamin Harrison appointed Frederick Douglass as Minister-Resident and Counsel General to the Republic of Haiti. Douglass had long admired the people of Haiti for fighting for and winning their independence, and, as this letter illustrates, he readily accepted the position. He served as Minister to Haiti until July 30, 1891. \n\n<strong>Reference Unit:</strong> National Archives at College Park Reference Section\n\n<strong>Persistent URL:</strong>  <a href=\"http://arcweb.archives.gov/arc/action/ExternalIdSearch?id=302033\" rel=\"nofollow\">arcweb.archives.gov/arc/action/ExternalIdSearch?id=302033</a>\n\n<strong>Repository Contact Information: </strong> Archives II Reference Section (Civilian), Textual Archives Services Division (Archives II Reference Section), National Archives at College Park, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD, 20740-6001. \n\nReproductions may be ordered via an independent vendor.
