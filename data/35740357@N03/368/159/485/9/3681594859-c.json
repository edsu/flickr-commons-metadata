I admit, being a dedicated airliner enthusiast, it was the airplane aspect that got me to click on it but there's so much more to it than that. I live in Southern California, and the way the trees and sidewalks and houses are arranged seems so old-fashioned compared to &quot;modern&quot; tightly-packed planned communities such as the one I lived in until recently. Then there's the whole aspect of having to actually live under the constant noise of an active airport, and the conflicting interests of commerce of the airport users and well-being of the citizens underneath it, which this image evokes well. Anyway, sorry for the long comment, but it's great to see this sort of image preserved in this format for the whole internet-going public to see.", "authorname": "jbp274", "id": "35717303-3681594859-72157623210501403", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/3681594859/#comment72157623218066671", "realname": "", "path_alias": "usnationalarchives", "author": "35740357@N03", "iconserver": "8547", "datecreate": "1265210998", "_content": "Thanks for this thoughtful comment posting.
