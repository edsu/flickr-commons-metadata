The story must refer to the crash of the Tupolev Tu-144 at the 1973 Paris Air Show on June 3, 1973.  All six of the crew on-board the Tu-144 were killed in the crash, as were eight people on the ground in a nearby Paris neighborhood where the wreckage came down. This would date the photo to June 4, 1973, or soon thereafter.", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "35717303-4726924151-72157625497053446", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/4726924151/#comment72157625501989866", "realname": "", "path_alias": "usnationalarchives", "author": "35740357@N03", "iconserver": "8547", "datecreate": "1291148521", "_content": "Hi TVL1970,\n\nThanks for your dedicated detective work on this photo!
