What happened to it: &quot;Sneaking in under the cover of darkness, city of Chicago construction crews began tearing up the runway at Meigs Field this morning at about 1:30 a.m. There was no advance warning, not even to the FAA. Some 16 aircraft are stranded on the field. A city source told the Chicago media that the &quot;airport is closed for good.&quot; How some reacted: &quot;I'm a little ashamed of Chicago right now,&quot; Inhofe told a public hearing in the Windy City. He (U.S. Senator Inhoffe) called Mayor Daley's midnight raid on Meigs Field &quot;an act of arrogant recklessness reminiscent of the 1920s, not the 21st century.&quot; The reality: Meigs Field is now referred to as Northerly Island and features outdoor recreation and entertainment opportunities for Chicago residents and visitors. Bravo, Mayor Daley.", "authorname": "I Brake 4 Snakes", "id": "35717303-5008203879-72157626915301992", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5008203879"}, "flarchive:created": 1387644858}
