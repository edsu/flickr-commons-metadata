It's taken from the back of the building from North Ave. \nBTW, I remember going there as a child in the early 70's before they closed.\n   Also, I lived next door in the Ford Factory (now they are lofts) and would go visit and explore the Sears Building (a.k.a. City Hall...LOL) in my free time. It was, when I lived there ('95-'97) mostly vacant. The Atlanta Police Dept. took up some of it, but otherwise it was vacant. Funny enough, they would let me by police security and let me roam the building. There were lots of old desks, phones, antiques, etc. Always wanted to &quot;snatch&quot; something, but my Mom and Dad raised me better. :)\n Also, on the top floor, you can see the 'tower&quot; in the center of the picture with the antenna on top, there is a water tower there! We would climb up the ladder and look in...it was still full of H2O and tempting on those hot summer days of ATL.\nJust my brush with history...", "authorname": "fotolocogringo", "id": "35717303-5008203967-72157626547019828", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/5008203967/#comment72157626577587176", "realname": "", "path_alias": "usnationalarchives", "author": "35740357@N03", "iconserver": "8547", "datecreate": "1303765095", "_content": "Thanks for sharing your memories of this area with us, fotolocogringo!\n\nMary (U.S. National Archives)", "authorname": "The U.S. National Archives", "id": "35717303-5008203967-72157626577587176", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/5008203967/#comment72157632351518187", "realname": "Warren Summers", "path_alias": "diminishedsanity", "author": "87317483@N06", "iconserver": "8070", "datecreate": "1356608153", "_content": "Definitely a view from North Avenue.
