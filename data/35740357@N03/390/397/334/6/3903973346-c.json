The 25th 747 built, its name was later changed to &quot;Clipper Ocean Spray&quot;, and served with Pan Am until the airline ended operations in December 1991. General Electric acquired the aircraft in September 1992 for its GE Aircraft Engines business.  GE Aircraft Engines converted the aircraft for use as a flying testbed for new jet engines, and changed its registration to N747GE.  N747GE is one of only a small number of 747-100 aircraft in operation still flying today.  Its use has been essential in developing GE's newest large jet engine, the GEnX, for both the 787 and 747-8 programs.  In addition, the aircraft still flies with much of its Pan Am interior still intact with seats remaining in the upper deck area and Pan Am blue rugs and accents (including on the overhead luggage bins) still in place.", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "35717303-3903973346-72157623505365386", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/3903973346/#comment72157623408667475", "realname": "", "path_alias": "usnationalarchives", "author": "35740357@N03", "iconserver": "8547", "datecreate": "1267453651", "_content": "TVL 1970,\n\nThanks for this very detailed and interesting information!\n\nJerry (U.S. National Archives)", "authorname": "The U.S. National Archives", "id": "35717303-3903973346-72157623408667475", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/3903973346/#comment72157629893197754", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "19658725@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1337966720", "_content": "The JFK VOR seems to still be there, beyond the &quot;P&quot; in Pan Am; gas tank at right was at 40.61333N 73.75434W.", "authorname": "tim_zukas", "id": "35717303-3903973346-72157629893197754", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3903973346"}, "flarchive:created": 1387670412}
