Being seated would have required awkward reaching and stretching thus creating additional strain on the women's backs.  Being seated would also have required lifting the clothing items at arms length rather than close to their bodies, again causing shoulder strain.\n\nIn my opinion being seated would have been worse for their general muscular well being.", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "35717303-3904009716-72157622200759481", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/3904009716/#comment72157622207110123", "realname": "", "path_alias": "usnationalarchives", "author": "35740357@N03", "iconserver": "8547", "datecreate": "1252614359", "_content": "I was thinking the same thing about it being easier to stand while ironing.
