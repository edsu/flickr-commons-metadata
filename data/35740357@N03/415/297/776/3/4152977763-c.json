When looking at other Navy images in this set this appears to be taken from the same ship and location as this: [http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/4152990717/]. If you search for: &quot;Hunchback&quot; you will find several examples in this set that feature the same structure.  The USS Hunchback is listed as a side-wheel steamer, not the USS Monitor, or any of the Monitor class ships, it was actually a ferry boat before the war and served as one after the war.  Hopefully this can get corrected.", "authorname": "civilwarin3d", "id": "35717303-4152977763-72157626731618439", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4152977763"}, "flarchive:created": 1387667094}
