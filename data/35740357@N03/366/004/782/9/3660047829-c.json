Night calls were handled by an operator who had a bedroom adjacent to the switchboard.\nAnd LD calls took a long time if they had to go through several relays, or if the receiving party did not have a dial phone.\nFurthermore, as recent as the 1960s,  it often took up to a half hour to call from America to parts of Europe.  An international operator in New York received a verbal request, and usually, the operator would call back when finally ther was an open line.\nTimes have changed so in recent decades; but somehow the old &quot;wierd&quot;  methods were more interesting than today's instantaneous automatic worldwide phone calls &quot;untouched by human hands.&quot;", "authorname": "stoppuller", "id": "35717303-3660047829-72157623722005256", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/3660047829/#comment72157623602286487", "realname": "", "path_alias": "usnationalarchives", "author": "35740357@N03", "iconserver": "8547", "datecreate": "1269869581", "_content": "Thanks for sharing your fascinating insight with us, stoppuller!\n\nJerry (U.S. National Archives)", "authorname": "The U.S. National Archives", "id": "35717303-3660047829-72157623602286487", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/3660047829/#comment72157625268604516", "realname": "", "path_alias": "o_b_mcclintock", "author": "43678707@N02", "iconserver": "5068", "datecreate": "1288386798", "_content": "This is an overseas 3CH board on the east coast. I was one of the first men hired about 40 years ago on the 3CL board.When I started with Bell I had to start on switchboards such as this. Rear cord for answer and front to key pulse out on. I also remember MX routing, npa, nxx, and terns like DA and BY. On the route and rate board I remember terms such as these; for numbers &quot;218 plus 7D or for operators 218 plus 065 plus&quot;, as an example. Or for a ring down we said: 218 plus 065, Springfield will answer.&quot; Its been over 40 years ago but it seems like just the other day.
