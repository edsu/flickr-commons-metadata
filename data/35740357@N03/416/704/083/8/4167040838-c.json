Commodore Barney (which I have not confirmed officially). The U.S.S. Commodore Barney had a round pilot house fore and aft with only two life boats port and starboard. If you look at the sketch by F.C.H. Bonwill submitted to Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper of Commodore Barney damaged by a &quot;torpedo&quot; (i.e. mine) on the James River in 1863, you will see the comparison. There is a picture of the Commodore Barney after her repair, which is another guess on my part, before her next river campaign. We are trying to confirm this for our website at NavSource Naval History.", "authorname": "Smokerider Bill", "id": "35717303-4167040838-72157629489382801", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/4167040838/#comment72157629258777774", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66406516@N08", "iconserver": "6070", "datecreate": "1332202835", "_content": "Converted New York City ferryboat U.S.S.
