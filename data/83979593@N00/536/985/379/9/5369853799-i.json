I am the facilitator for communications in the Director\u2019s office \u2013 overseeing the grapevine, and those all staff e-mails. Additionally, I arrange meetings for the Director and act as a greeter for dignitaries and celebrities. I\u2019ve met everyone from Farah Fawcett to Leonard Nimoy.  Artists such as Ron Mueck , Hernan Bas, Fred Tomaselli , Swoon, Murakami, Annie Leibovitz and countless others.  Judy Chicago certainly gives me a hug and kiss every time I see her.\n\n<strong>How long have been at the Brooklyn Museum?</strong>\n\nJust starting my eleventh year now, but as of this past September, I\u2019ve cut back to 3 days a week.\n\n<strong>Why just 3 days?</strong>\n\nI am completing a Master\u2019s of Social Work at Fordham University and am interning at a mobile soup kitchen providing social services to Brooklyn\u2019s neediest.\n\n<strong>Providing social services \u2013you do a lot of that here at the museum as well. Can you give some examples?</strong>\n\nI provide information to the staff and sometimes lend my ear to those who need me. I have been known to assist with everything from employee\u2019s love lives to their diets.\n\n<strong>Yes, I\u2019ve heard you are partially responsible for an engagement and several births.</strong>\n\nPerhaps.\n\n<strong>Do you have a favorite piece or collection here and why?</strong>\n\nI like the Egyptian <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/3641/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Sculpture of Erotic Group</em></a>. It\u2019s nice to know the ancients had a sense of humor.\n\n<strong>I\u2019ve heard that you yourself have several collections. What are they?</strong>\n\nEverything from Santos to chamber pots, but I think I\u2019m most proud of my collection of the portraits of myself done by my artist friends. Quite a few of them even work here like Katie Welty (Registrar\u2019s Office), Elaine Komorowski (Collections Management), and Jason Grunwald (Art Handler). One of the artists featured in 1st Fans, Matt Held, did me as well.\n\n<strong>What has been your most interesting experience here?</strong>\n\nWorking here on 9/11 was surreal. We all gathered in the 6th floor window watching the smoke, not knowing what was happening.  No one really left work and I found it comforting being with others during that time.  I remember Arnold called us into the auditorium for an all-staff to brief us on what little we knew.  It took 3 hours to get home that night and most everyone came in to work the next day. I was proud that the Museum was open then \u2013 it was important to show that New York institutions would keep running.\n\n<strong>What were you doing before you came to the Museum?</strong>\n\nI was a stock broker and options principal on Wall Street for seven years while getting my Master\u2019s in Art History from CUNY.  Previous to working on Wall Street I worked for a French Art Gallery and a Swedish Art Gallery which sparked my interest in the arts.\n\n<strong>What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong>\n\nI wanted to be an architect like Mike Brady from The Brady Bunch.  How funny is that?\n\n<strong>So in the tradition of Brooklyn\u2019s Finest, I have to ask: What is your commute like?</strong>\n\nAlthough I live on Prospect Park in Windsor Terrace, there are no direct transit options. I take a ride when I can get one, I walk, and I\u2019m seriously considering getting a bicycle."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "794", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-01-18 16:57:36", "lastupdate": "1295644887", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1295455101"}, "originalsecret": "db592ddd23", "license": "2", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5166", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/5369853799/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
