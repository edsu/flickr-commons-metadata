Created by New York\u2013based artist Lee Mingwei, the interactive installation also includes single blossoms arranged around the channel, which visitors are invited to take when they leave the Museum, on the condition that they make a detour on the way to their next destination and give the flower to a stranger as a gift. As the day wears on, the flowers on the table disappear, one by one. The next day, they are replaced, and the cycle begins again.\n\n<i><a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/moving_garden/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Moving Garden</a></i>\nOctober 5, 2011\u2013January 22, 2012"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "817", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-10-05 15:32:43", "lastupdate": "1326140352", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1317843163"}, "originalsecret": "c114754d23", "license": "2", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6104", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/6214783631/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
