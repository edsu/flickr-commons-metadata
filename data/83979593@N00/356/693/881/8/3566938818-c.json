Between this and the blog and the behind the scenes video on YouTube, you guys at the Brooklyn Museum are really doing a lot more than a lot of museums... it's wonderful to get to see the behind the scenes stuff, to feel like a little bit more of an insider, and a member of the community.\n\nI look forward to visiting the museum again soon, to see the newly renovated exhibit.", "authorname": "toranosuke", "id": "3064182-3566938818-72157618823728806", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3566938818"}}
