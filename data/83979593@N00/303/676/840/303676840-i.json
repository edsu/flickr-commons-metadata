She immediately began working with Annie Leibovitz, and together they produced countless covers, features, and special projects, including the Olympic portfolios, Hall of Fame galleries, and the renowned Hollywood issues.  Together, Annie and Jane have created some of the most celebrated fold-out covers and have worked on photo shoots of the world's most accomplished actors, musicians, athletes, dancers, writers, politicians, directors, media moguls, and captains of industry.  Throughout their partnership, they have captured history---ranging from Michael Jackson at the peak of his popularity, to a naked, pregnant Demi Moore, to baby Suri Cruise. Jane has booked almost all of Annie's shoots since 1985, and she and Annie are currently at work on the 2007 Vanity Fair Hollywood issue."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3469", "farm": 1, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2006-08-02 10:04:06", "lastupdate": "1268661408", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1164222649"}, "originalsecret": "cce8aee3b3", "license": "0", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "104", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/303676840/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
