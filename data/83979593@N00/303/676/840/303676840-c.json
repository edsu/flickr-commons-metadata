The talk is vane, full of celebrity gossip but when she is asked a very simple question (what camera does she [Leibovitz] uses?) the answer is &quot;I don't know&quot;. Mrs. O'Connor fails to address even a hint of critique to Mrs. Leibovitz work and certainly not an artistic nor an academic reference is given to approach Mrs. Leibovitz's photographies. Truly disappointing talk. Don't even bother listening unless you enjoy the petty-gossip and the repetition of common places.", "authorname": "cronopiable", "id": "3064182-303676840-72157623610834194", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/303676840/#comment72157623500362155", "realname": "Brooklyn Museum", "path_alias": "brooklyn_museum", "author": "83979593@N00", "iconserver": "7330", "datecreate": "1268661408", "_content": "Thanks for the crit, cronopiable.
