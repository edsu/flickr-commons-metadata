Even Germany was welcomed \u2014 the first time that the new German nation had ever participated in a French exposition. After the defeat of the French at the hands of the rising German Empire in 1871, La France did not deign to invite the new nation to the expositions of 1878 or 1889. But time, and the courteous idolatry of French culture by cultured Germans, soothed old wounds. Kaiser Wilhelm, gallant as a young officer, filled the German pavilions with tributes to French culture, and graced the German exhibits catalog with this tribute:\n\nCan one contribute more nobly to the great peaceful festival of the universal exposition than by recalling, by this return to the past, the memory of what the German people owes, in the domain of art, to its neighbor, and the memory of the homage rendered by Frederick the Great, one of the greatest minds of all time, to French civilization and art? &quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://charon.sfsu.edu/publications/PARISEXPOSITIONS/1900EXPO.html\">charon.sfsu.edu/publications/PARISEXPOSITIONS/1900EXPO.html</a>", "authorname": "Ruth Flickr", "id": "3064182-2486001439-72157612318555755", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2486001439/#comment72157625691766853", "realname": "Amr Boghdady", "path_alias": "boghdady", "author": "58303967@N06", "iconserver": "5005", "datecreate": "1294959371", "_content": "Love that image!\nWould I be allowed to add it to my German website found at <a href=\"http://www.Deutsched.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.Deutsched.com</a> ?\nPlease let me know if it's ok or not, I'll leave all due credits :)\n\nThanks!", "authorname": "Amr Boghdady", "id": "3064182-2486001439-72157625691766853", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2486001439/#comment72157625866685004", "realname": "Brooklyn Museum", "path_alias": "brooklyn_museum", "author": "83979593@N00", "iconserver": "7330", "datecreate": "1295529311", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/boghdady] \nHi Amr --\nYou are welcome to add this image to your website.
