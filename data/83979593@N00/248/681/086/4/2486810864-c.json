The following citation yields an image and information for the \u201cPennsylvania\u201d of the Hamburg-America Line, which leads us to believe it may be the ship in the photo. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Pennsylvania_(1896)\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Pennsylvania_(1896)</a>", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-2486810864-72157606872661358", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2486810864/#comment72157606875979318", "realname": "Edward Hoover", "path_alias": "edwardaggie98", "author": "69398923@N00", "iconserver": "1079", "datecreate": "1219362097", "_content": "Interesting history - thanks for the update!", "authorname": "Edward Hoover", "id": "3064182-2486810864-72157606875979318", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2486810864/#comment72157622974467228", "realname": "Greg Pizzoli", "path_alias": "doctorpizzoli", "author": "30708435@N08", "iconserver": "3244", "datecreate": "1260466379", "_content": "How long would the NY to Paris voyage typically take?", "authorname": "Greg Pizzoli", "id": "3064182-2486810864-72157622974467228", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2486810864"}}
