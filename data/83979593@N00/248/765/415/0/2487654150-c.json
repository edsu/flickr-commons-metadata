The statues are all of Ramses II, one of ancient Egypt's greatest, and most prolific, pharaohs. This temple featured his likeness, and the temple next to it featured his wife, Nefertari. Abu Simbel was actually moved in the 1970s when Egypt decided to build the Aswan Dam, because the lake would cover the temples. The move was very precise. The temple was built so that the sun would shine into the inner temple one day a year, supposedly the day of Ramses' coronation. The engineers that moved the temple didn't hit the exact day...they were off by only one day, though.", "authorname": "MRHSfan", "id": "3064182-2487654150-72157612918238974", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2487654150/#comment72157613010373963", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "78715331@N00", "iconserver": "67", "datecreate": "1233073755", "_content": "Discovery Channel did a show on the move.
