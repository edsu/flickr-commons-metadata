Meanwhile, Group XII of the exposition was devoted to &quot;Decoration and Furniture&quot; (like the tapestries and furniture shown here), which seem to have been spread out between the &quot;Palaces on the Square of the Invalids&quot;.  The Palace of Manufactures is described as one of these, but it's very difficult to determine which parts of Group XII were displayed in which buildings.  For caption purposes we could maybe say that the interior is likely part of the &quot;Decoration and Furniture&quot; group, but that the specific interior location is uncertain. \n</blockquote>\n\nLooking at some modern photos of the Petit Palais, I do seen the barrel vaulting as in this image, but I'm not convinced that it's really that building.\n\nMore research?\nDeb Wythe\nDigital Lab, Brooklyn Museum", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-2486783230-72157630437821108", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2486783230/#comment72157630529447292", "realname": "Brooklyn Museum", "path_alias": "brooklyn_museum", "author": "83979593@N00", "iconserver": "7330", "datecreate": "1342020233", "_content": "But, then we also found this:\n<blockquote>During the Exposition the Petit Palais hosted a series of exhibits illustrating the history of French Art from 1800 to 1900, which emphasized its various stages of growth (Boyd, 167). The interior was composed of an inner gallery, with many priceless treasures in ivory, tapestry, metal work, jewelry, and porcelain gathered from the most important collections of France, and an outer gallery devoted to a collection of royal French furniture (Butler, 298). Among displays were brass and bronze works, statues and the Armor of King Francis I (Boyd, 200).
