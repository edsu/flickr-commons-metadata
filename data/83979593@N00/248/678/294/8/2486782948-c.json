This <a href=\"http://www.lib.umd.edu/digital/worldsfairs/essay.jsp?pid=umd:100\">site provides information</a> on the Petit Palais, so we were able to confirm.\n\n \u201cDuring the Exposition the Petit Palais hosted a series of exhibits illustrating the history of French Art from 1800 to 1900, which emphasized its various stages of growth (Boyd, 167). The interior was composed of an inner gallery, with many priceless treasures in ivory, tapestry, metal work, jewelry, and porcelain gathered from the most important collections of France, and an outer gallery devoted to a collection of royal French furniture (Butler, 298). Among displays were brass and bronze works, statues and the Armor of King Francis I (Boyd, 200). These various exhibits impressed most visitors. \u201c \n\nIn addition, <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/archives/image/3090/image \">another slide identified</a> as Petit Palais illustrates the same mix of item types as in the unidentified slide.\n\nThanks,\n\nEd &amp; Angie, Brooklyn Museum Archives", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-2486782948-72157617303353208", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2486782948"}}
