I lucked out getting the professor I had, she showed us 45 minutes of these shots everyday for 3 years, she had. She said she had been everywhere except N. Vietnam &amp; China and was going my last year there. I used to ask her at the end of the class, &quot; how many people lived in those days and were they all artists &quot; ? She always had her 80+ friend sitting near the artifact. She said these stones weighed about 86 tons and somehow they were put on top of the vert. ones. Amazing, Special, I wonder who got her photos?

Like so many other important museums in the world (Louvre, Metropolitan Museum etc) your great museum allows taking pictures. Visitors feel happy when they can take their camera inside the museum, and they can tell so much more to other people how fantastic this museum is by showing their pictures (of course all made without flash!).\nEvery time I visit the States I try to visit the Brooklyn Museum.\nA small enigma remains.\nDuring my most recent visit in 2007 I hoped to see the spectacular statue of Amenhotep III (also called Amenophis III). But it was not there. I wondered what happened with it. I hope that this greatest treasure of your museum will come back in the permanent collection of the Brooklyn Museum. If not, why? I was realy a little bit disappointed.\nHere is the photo that I made of the statue in the year 2000.\nThanks for your comments and lots of gratitude to the Brooklyn Museum.\nHans\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/menesje/458722359/\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/185/458722359_74e51e1cea.jpg\" width=\"324\" height=\"500\" alt=\"1990 33 Farao Amenophis III in het Brooklyn Museum, New York\" /></a>\nHead of a good-looking pharaoh Amenophis III (Amenhotep III).\nIn this over life-sized interpretation we see him wearing the blue crown.", "authorname": "Hans Ollermann", "id": "3064182-2488806425-72157605390282457", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2488806425/#comment72157605442757025", "realname": "Brooklyn Museum", "path_alias": "brooklyn_museum", "author": "83979593@N00", "iconserver": "7330", "datecreate": "1212628712", "_content": "Hi Hans,  if you have a second, Flickr mail me an email address?
