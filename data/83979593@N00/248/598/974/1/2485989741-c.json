Dallin</a> (1861-1944) was a sculptor, teacher and writer in Arlington, Massachusetts. He specialized in Native American subjects.\n\n&quot;In 1897 Dallin departed for Paris, where he studied under Jean Dampt. &nbsp;Dallin was represented at the Salon that year by a curious and charming little equestrian statuette of Don Quixote, and the following year by a marble bust of a young lady. But his interest in Indian themes continued, and, in 1898, he was working on the second of his major equestrian monuments\u2014<b>&quot;Medicine Man.&quot;</b> \n\n&quot;It won high praise at the Salon of 1899 and was given a place of honor and a gold medal at the great Paris Exposition of 1900. According to reports, several Austrians were empowered to purchase it for their country, only to be disappointed when it was obtained for Fairmount Park in Philadelphia, where it may be still seen today.&quot; [<a href=\"http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/dallin.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>]\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lblanchard/7687141616/\" title=\"2012-07-27_01fairmountpark by lblanchard, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8289/7687141616_13a696cced_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"2012-07-27_01fairmountpark\" /></a>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The Medicine Man&quot; Fairmount Park, Philadelphia &nbsp; by <i>Laura Blanchard</i>", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "3064182-2485989741-72157633505115403", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2485989741"}}
