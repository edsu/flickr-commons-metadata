That is, right between the Seine and the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe 'Greek Warrior' statue of the man and horse currently stands at the southeast corner of the bridge. When this picture was taken, in 1900, it stood at the southwest corner. This picture looks from the left bank to the right bank. Across the bridge stands the Palais de Chaillot, just visible at the extreme right, where currently stands the Trocad\u00e9ro. The Republican Guard in this picture face the Eiffel Tower, if they ride their horses in the same direction for 100 meters they are right below the Tower.\n\nFor the world's Fair of 1937 the statue was replaced a little bit to allow the bridge to be widened. It was also turned ninety degrees. The Palais de Chaillot was demolished and made way for the 1937 Palais de Trocad\u00e9ro. All of which has since been left untouched.", "authorname": "Schele Arie", "id": "3064182-2486801084-72157626821849290", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2486801084/#comment72157626745132751", "realname": "Brooklyn Museum", "path_alias": "brooklyn_museum", "author": "83979593@N00", "iconserver": "7330", "datecreate": "1307037277", "_content": "Hello Schele Arie --\nThanks for adding all the great information about location and context!\nDeb Wythe\nBrooklyn Museum Digital Lab", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-2486801084-72157626745132751", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2486801084"}}
