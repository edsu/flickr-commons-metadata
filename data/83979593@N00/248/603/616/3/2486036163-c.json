This is in a drawer alongside photos documenting a steamship leaving for Europe, presumably from New York and this may be an island (Fort Lafayette?) in the harbor.  In a letter dated July 8, 1900, Goodyear describes his booking on a ship leaving NY on July 14th, landing at Charbourg and then on to Paris. [W.H. Goodyear Collection Dept. of Fine Arts [3.1.007]] This image is part of the Paris Exposition group of slides and may possibly be a record of his travel to the exposition. We\u2019ll use the information to update our catalog record.\n\nFort Lafayette was used as a prison during the Civil War and transformed into a munitions store before being demolished around 1962, and the site used as the foundation for the Brooklyn side tower of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.   The links contain drawings, photos and historical documentation for Fort Lafayette. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?d1=1779#2/\">www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?d1=1779#2/</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/_yB-_hXzzS_8/RzEM_lA7YxI/AAAAAAAAIsw/K3GIZE7jlqs/Fort+Lafayette05.jpg\">lh3.ggpht.com/_yB-_hXzzS_8/RzEM_lA7YxI/AAAAAAAAIsw/K3GIZE...</a> \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lafayette\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lafayette</a>", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-2486036163-72157606225702282", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2486036163"}}
