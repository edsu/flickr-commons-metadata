There's a bit of ...ahem...copyr!ghted material in the vid, so we are borrowing it for just a little while to show you and then it will come down.\n\nYour participation in our efforts both online and at the Museum have made all the difference and these awards belong to you as much as they do us.  Many countless thank yous from our team for your ongoing support of the Brooklyn Museum.
