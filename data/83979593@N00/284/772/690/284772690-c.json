Good observation on your part regarding the gloves and un-gloved hands. It is most often the case that artists tend to be 'tactile' and intimately familiar with handling their own work and property. This Ron Mueck sculpture, consistent with the artist's other work is a (fantastic!) hybrid of modern materials such as fiberglass, nylon, resins, pigments and mixed mediums. At the Museum - as the borrowing institution - we have a responsibility to not impart harm on the art object, as it is not ours. We made the protection of the painted surface our priority. As a rule, professional Art Handlers will wear gloves to prevent oils from their hands from transferring on to the art: Those oils can 'etch' into some surfaces and/or attract dirt that can damage the surface.", "authorname": "Brooklyn-Walter-Collections", "id": "3064182-284772690-72157624411707007", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/284772690/#comment72157624420090543", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51417385@N04", "iconserver": "4080", "datecreate": "1279642939", "_content": "Hi Walter, \n\nThanks for you response!

In addition to what Walter says, some artists are actually very particular about their art work.  One that comes to mind is Murakami.  He is very attuned to the delicacy of the painted surfaces of his paintings and sculpture.  During the installation of the Murakami show at the museum, even he wore gloves when handling his art works.", "authorname": "artconservator", "id": "3064182-284772690-72157624421181925", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "284772690"}}
