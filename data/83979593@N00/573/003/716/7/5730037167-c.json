It is more of a dream than a personal memory.  I realized after I made this work that in many of my other drawings the subjects are slightly oblivious to their surroundings. In this case she is not only aware but possibly an active participant in what is going on in front of her.  I hoped the viewer would question why the woman was there watching this building burn and her motives. The title &quot;Last Night&quot; may refer to yesterday or the last night of a period of time. \n\nThanks again for your interest!\nKatie", "authorname": "misswelty", "id": "3064182-5730037167-72157626828191765", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "5730037167"}}
