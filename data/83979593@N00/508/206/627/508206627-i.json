Brooklyn Museum teens meet with artist <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/sperber/\">Devorah Sperber</a> at her studio in Woodstock, New York.  The trip to the studio was an opportunity for the students to see Devorah's working process as well as some other projects she has completed.\n\nThe Brooklyn Museum Teen Master Class engages high school students in the critical study of an exhibition, an artist, and a medium. Over the course of three workshops, students meet with a professional artist to investigate contemporary art-making via analysis of works on view at the Museum, discussion about working process at the artist\u2019s studio, and creation of a work of art to be exhibited in the Education Gallery for three months.\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "321", "farm": 1, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2007-04-14 12:42:03", "lastupdate": "1213295721", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1179776465"}, "originalsecret": "0c05baf1eb", "license": "0", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "202", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/508206627/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
