I wonder if it was built there to show one religion taking over another, ancient Egyptian to Muslim... (Of course by the time this was built, the Egyptian faith was long gone, but the temple was still clearly visible!) I also wonder if there was a Coptic church built inside this temple, as a means of converting the people of the time? \n\nI get the impression that different religions build in the same place. Not just in Luxor but all over the world. Maybe it's more resourceful than building from scratch on a brand new site? Or maybe it shows superiority of one religion over another? (This isn't a critique of religion overall, just a historically minded observation...I find this interesting.)", "authorname": "Whiskers and Whispers (The Future is Feline)", "id": "3064182-3294998699-72157614115747151", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/3294998699/#comment72157614162968318", "realname": "CJ Nye", "path_alias": "cjn212", "author": "24940787@N02", "iconserver": "8067", "datecreate": "1235161957", "_content": "Ooooh!", "authorname": "cjn212", "id": "3064182-3294998699-72157614162968318", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/3294998699/#comment72157614118877623", "realname": "gore b", "path_alias": "goreb", "author": "30425262@N00", "iconserver": "13", "datecreate": "1235164108", "_content": "ha. i was just there.", "authorname": "goreb83", "id": "3064182-3294998699-72157614118877623", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/3294998699/#comment72157614119773687", "realname": "Brooklyn Museum", "path_alias": "brooklyn_museum", "author": "83979593@N00", "iconserver": "7330", "datecreate": "1235166217", "_content": "goreb83!  i was just looking at your pics and indeed - you were just there!  how are things...you still in CA?  ~shelley", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-3294998699-72157614119773687", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/3294998699/#comment72157614164650663", "realname": "", "path_alias": "it-is-aai", "author": "91271949@N00", "iconserver": "4", "datecreate": "1235215735", "_content": "Isn't the gate that 'opens' to the temple (which can't be used anymore) also older?
