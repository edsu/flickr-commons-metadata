Most of this content can be found on the Web or on kiosks that are located throughout the Museum. I'm also in charge of setting up and maintaining all of the computer and iPod kiosks throughout the Museum and in the galleries. I work closely with the designers, registrars, artists, carpenters, electricians, and painters.\n\n<strong>What was your craziest filming experience? </strong>\n\nBefore <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/murakami/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>\u00a9 MURAKAMI</em></a> opened we did <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/murakami/video.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">a time lapse video of the installation of <em>Mr. Pointy</em></a>, which took two full days of filming. The first day <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/2008/04/03/the-making-of-mr-pointy-comes-to-brooklyn/\" rel=\"nofollow\">I had to stand on the roof of an apartment building across from the Museum</a> on Eastern Parkway. I had to talk to the landlord and convince him to let me run power up to the roof...where I stayed for the next 6 hours. It was 40 degrees and so windy and I froze my butt off. At least I had an intern up there with me (she wanted to leave but I made her stay so I wasn't the only one suffering. Sorry, Francesca.).\n\nThe most interesting filming experience I had here happened just a couple of weeks ago when I filmed the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcXTX0MDJvo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">conservators rewrapping the &quot;Anonymous Man&quot; mummy</a>. It took 4 days to film, and it was very interesting and extremely tiring. I'll never forget the smell of that mummy.\n\n<strong>What was your last job before the Museum? </strong>\n\nI was a nurse at an animal hospital. I was doing that to make a living while I was in school in Boston.\n\n<strong>What did you go to school for? </strong>\n\nI went to the Berkelee College of Music for film scoring and music synthesis.\n\n<strong>Sounds like a not-so-hidden talent... </strong>\n\nYea, I try to keep up with my music when I'm not at the Museum. I've done a couple of solo acoustic shows and am working on starting two bands this summer.\n\nI'm also going to be put out some of my own films soon, and they'll feature my original music.\n\n<strong>What did you want to be when you grew up? </strong>\n\nI actually wanted to be an entomologist. Is that what it's called? It's a scientist who studies insects.\n\n<strong>What's your commute like?</strong>\n\nI drive from Sunnyside, Queens so most mornings I have to text Shelley that I'm going to be anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour late. The traffic on the Kosciuszko Bridge is just so terrible! Day in and day out I have so much road rage... it drives me crazy."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "813", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2008-10-25 12:55:38", "lastupdate": "1291658767", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1272900405"}, "originalsecret": "0bda10a1ee", "license": "2", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3335", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/4574578109/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
