For discovery, he was unwrapped at that time (today we'd use less invasive methods for discovery like x-rays or CT scanning). Currently, the Brooklyn Museum conservation team are working to re-wrap him with his original linens. so he can go on display in the upcoming exhibition, <i><a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/mummy_chamber/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Mummy Chamber</a></i>.  \n\nWe don't know much about the anonymous man because he was found in a simple unmarked coffin when he was excavated.  We do know he is a Roman period mummy and he died around 300AD.  Because Roman techniques of mummification used less resin and limited its use to the body itself, the linens have been well preserved and can be reused today with the addition of newer materials to help bind the layers together as we go.\n\nThis process was originally live tweeted using the #mummywrap hash tag.  On Flickr, we suggest looking at the sets by day and in order to best see the process as it unfolds.
