We typically transcribe it all, so what you see is everything we have. \nThese slides were collected by our curator, W.H. Goodyear, in the early years of the 20th century.  <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/ifa/NALSS/VList_2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">A survey of lantern slide collections</a> lists T.H. MacAllister as 'active 1890s+' -- which gives you some idea of the date, though he could certainly have reproduced an earlier photograph. \nDeb Wythe, Digital Lab", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-2674903574-72157625033497904", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2674903574/#comment72157625043917408", "realname": "John", "path_alias": "jennyoverall", "author": "25136959@N07", "iconserver": "3002", "datecreate": "1285583223", "_content": "Thanks - that's interesting. The pose, hair, the make-up, the ornaments, the dress pattern and style are virtually timeless. You could see a woman looking just like this in many countries today. \n\nIn western cultures in early days of photography the subjects tended to look straight at the camera and adopt quite a stern looking expression - presumably because of the length of exposure; but the effect is to give the impression that we were all stiff and starchy and pompous back in those days.\n\nThis woman looks natural, if a little shy  and rather demure - enigmatic might be the right word - striking certainly.", "authorname": "john8abalone", "id": "3064182-2674903574-72157625043917408", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2674903574"}}
