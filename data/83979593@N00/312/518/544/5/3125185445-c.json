I thought this was great, because while we have <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/exhibitions/browse/1990s\">photography for later exhibitions</a> we don't have much for the earlier ones like the <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/exhibitions/3031/Dutch_East_Indian_Art\">Dutch East Indian Art</a> exhibition which this release comments on. It's just another example of the potential of the Flickr Commons.\n\nOver the past few months I've been scanning and using OCR software on the entirety of the Museum's exhibition-related archival press releases. It's a daunting task, but it has tremendous potential. Eventually these releases (both the scans and searchable text) will be added to the <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/exhibitions/\">Exhibition Index</a>, providing descriptions and details for the exhibitions without photography and enriching those with images.\n\nTheir potential can go beyond simply describing previous exhibitions though. For example, it provides an opportunity to examine the language and presentation of a museum over decades. Or to look for a particular individual's involvement with the Museum over a extended period of time, for example see page 5 of this release which features the guest list for the event described, one of many.", "authorname": "erin_trying (Bklyn)", "id": "3064182-3125185445-72157611527440898", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/3125185445/#comment72157611460852807", "realname": "mary", "path_alias": null, "author": "42614915@N00", "iconserver": "12", "datecreate": "1229978942", "_content": "This is very cool, it's like a bit of history beyond photos.
