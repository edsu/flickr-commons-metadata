A visitor who has seen at least five studios will become eligible to nominate three artists for the \u201cGo\u201d museum show. Museum curators will visit the 10 most popular artists\u2019 studios and from that group will make selections for the exhibition, on view at the museum from Dec. 1 to Feb. 24.\n\nWeb and mobile technology is central to the project. Artists must register at <a href=\"http://www.gobrooklynart.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.gobrooklynart.org</a> from June 4 to 29. Visitors to the artists\u2019 studios must also register, either by sending a text message to a number listed on posters at each studio or by entering a studio number using a \u201cGo\u201d mobile application. Visitor registration opens on Aug. 1 and runs through the open studio weekend, Sept. 8 and 9.\n\n\u201cOne hopes we\u2019ll see new artists\u2019 work,\u201d said Sharon Matt Atkins, the managing curator of exhibitions at the museum, who has organized the project with Shelley Bernstein, the museum\u2019s chief of technology.\n\nMs. Bernstein said that the point of the project is to get area residents out to really look at art. \u201cWe\u2019re opening up the curatorial process,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s museum as hub.\u201d\n\nCarol Vogel, New York Times, May 18, 2012.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.gobrooklynart.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.gobrooklynart.org/</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "843", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2012-05-18 12:27:54", "lastupdate": "1354573408", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1337358474"}, "originalsecret": "934b04b5c0", "license": "2", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7102", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/7222179042/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
