So the story is actually on Twitter.  We have some information on that in the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/sets/72157620271417600/\">set description</a> including how to search our hashtag, but depending on how you arrived at the photos, I can see how it would be confusing!  Maybe next time we will just use something like twitpic to accompany photos to tweets, rather than trying to cross-platform the whole event.  That might work a little better.  Thanks for the helpful feedback!  ~Shelley\n\nEdit:  For now, I've batch appended the caption from the set to all the photos, which should help a little.
