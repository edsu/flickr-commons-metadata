Riley is launching the project, <i>Those About to Die We Salute You</i> on August 13th with an actual naval battle in Flushing Meadows, including hand-to-hand combat. \n\n<i>Those About to Die Salute You</i>, a battle on water wielded with baguette swords and watermelon cannon balls by New York\u2019s art dignitaries will take place on Thursday, August 13th, 2009 at 6 pm in a flooded World\u2019s Fair-era reflecting pool in Flushing Meadows Corona Park, just outside of the Queens Museum of Art. Various types of vessels have been designed and constructed by artist provocateur Duke Riley and his collaborators: the galleons, some made of reeds harvested in the park, will be used to stage a citywide battle of the art museums in which representatives from the Queens Museum of Art, the <b>Brooklyn Museum</b>, Bronx Museum of the Arts, and El Museo del Barrio will battle before a toga-clad crowd of frenzied onlookers. \n\nThe event is free and open to public. <a href=\"http://www.queensmuseum.org/naval-battle-performance-launch-pad-artist-in-residency-duke-riley-those-about-to-die-salute-you\" rel=\"nofollow\">More info</a>\n\nDress code: Toga.
