Goodyear was a curator and an architectural historian, so he definitely came at shooting from a different angle.  I had read in The Devil in the White City that Burnham heavily regulated photography, so often what we see in photographs of the fair is the sanctioned view from the fair's organizers.  I'm not sure how Goodyear got the shots he did, but the fact that they show a different scene, actually makes them more powerful for me personally because they are so honest :)  Deirdre just posted a bit more on Goodyear in <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/2009/01/12/the-world-through-goodyear%e2%80%99s-eyes-photographs-from-the-1890%e2%80%99s-to-1923-from-the-brooklyn-museum-archives/\">today's blog post</a>.\n\nShelley,\nChief of Technology", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-2784211229-72157612485513606", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2784211229/#comment72157612492192992", "realname": "Rob Ketcherside", "path_alias": "tigerzombie", "author": "29056926@N02", "iconserver": "3136", "datecreate": "1231788364", "_content": "@Brooklyn_Museum: this is something that confused me recently.

I had been thinking recently that the Goodyear photos you've posted are amazingly focused - none cover the southern area (where the livestock yards were), and the northern area (with the various state buildings) is barely seen as well.  I realized that from ground level, the Ferris Wheel (over 250 feet high) doesn't even appear in shots of the Court of Honor and Lagoon.  Most photos from rooftops still maintain the illusion, often with Lake Michigan in the background and sometimes with unidentifiable stretches of small buildings in the city.\n\nWith all that in mind, I was surprised to see the livestock yards.\n\nOn a related note, have you noticed how many ladders are visible in the photos from above?  I've seen at least a few.  There must have been photographers climbing everywhere.", "authorname": "Rob Ketcherside", "id": "3064182-2784211229-72157612522569480", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2784211229/#comment72157612557161591", "realname": "Brooklyn Museum", "path_alias": "brooklyn_museum", "author": "83979593@N00", "iconserver": "7330", "datecreate": "1232041875", "_content": "From Angie:\n\nYes, the Goodyear collection of lantern slides, not just the World's Columbian Exposition, came from various sources. Some Goodyear took, some were taken by photographers who traveled with him and some he got from outside sources. It is not exactly clear how these slides were obtained. He used these for his research and for his lectures. When we scanned these, we tried to capture as much information from the originals. If there were names or companies on them, we also included this information to help identify where the lantern slide came from. This is an example of a name we found on the original slide and added to the description.
