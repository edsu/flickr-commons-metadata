W. Darlington, who built many &quot;electric fountains&quot; from the 1890s onward. The outer &quot;basketweave&quot; or Wheatsheaf&quot; spray rings, which encircle glass lenses, were one of his signature effects. Beneath were arc lights and sliding color filters (if this was like other Darlington fountains, in nine colors) operated, along with the multiple water effects, heights of the sprays etc. from a below-ground room by live 'performers'.", "authorname": "Jonas Clark", "id": "3064182-2785070138-72157617373293556", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2785070138/#comment72157623854376172", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "39825652@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1271268490", "_content": "This fountain was one of two identical ones at the Expo and were designed by Luther Stieringer of the General Electric company who was the consulting electrical engineer of the Expo.", "authorname": "dshaw2", "id": "3064182-2785070138-72157623854376172", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2785070138"}}
