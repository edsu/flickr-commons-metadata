I just wanted to add that, actually, the paid attendance total for July 4, 1893, a magnificent day in the history of the World's Fair, was 283, 273; that was more than for the entire first week of the fair but not globally record-breaking. That would happen a few months later on October 9, 1893, which was designated as &quot;Chicago Day.&quot; Total paid attendance for that day totaled 713,646 -- shattering the world record at the time, which was held by the Paris exposition (of Eiffel Tower Fame) in 1889 with 397,000. These numbers are from the fascinating account of the World's Columbian Exposition by Erik Larson, &quot;Devil in the White City.&quot;", "authorname": "luvpiggies", "id": "3064182-2785069966-72157629758359076", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2785069966"}}
