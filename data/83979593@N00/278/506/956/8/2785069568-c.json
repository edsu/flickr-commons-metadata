Nikola Tesla had gotten the contracts to do all of the exposition based on  both the greater efficiency, the brighter light output, and the ability to produce all of the needed power for the fair onsite; the generators were sited near the hall of technology and on constant exhibit. (The Exposition was the first time that the now ever-present  glow of light over a city were visible). The AC power supplied for the fair equaled almost three times the total electrical power supplied to the rest of the city.", "authorname": "waupacaman", "id": "3064182-2785069568-72157632387490019", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2785069568"}}
