The original Statue of the Republic was more than 60 feet tall and was destroyed after the fair. A 1/3 replica was placed in Jackson Park in 1918. This is probably the statue your grandfather posed in front of. (Look at the scale.) \n\nHowever, I notice that the statue's right hand is missing the eagle that sits upon the sphere. The staff in the left had is different from the original, but that is by design. According to hydepark.org, &quot;The original had the left hand holding a lance decorated with laurel leaves and a Phrygian Cap representing the French Revolution. Perhaps because the mid/late 1910's was a time of reaction and fear of communism, anarchism and the Bolsheviks, a staff with a laurel wreath was used.&quot;\n\nHere is a photo I took recently of the replica that stands in Jackson park. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/vegasrob/2982623039/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3012/2982623039_194672c337_m.jpg\" title=\"The Statue of the Republic (by Roaming Vegas)\" alt=\"The Statue of the Republic (by Roaming Vegas)\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" /></a>", "authorname": "Rob LaRosa (Roaming Vegas)", "id": "3064182-2785068208-72157613152128449", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2785068208/#comment72157616161878577", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "37013267@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1238654364", "_content": "Yes that is the replica of the origional statue in your grand pa's photo.  I am not certain but it seems that the replica was placed at the opposite end of the reflecting pond to where the origional statue was position...  I have visited this statue many times,..it is located at the park just south of the Museum of Science and Industry (the remaining origional building of the world's fair of 1893).  It seems that the replica statue faces east where the origional statue faces west (from what old photos show).  I may be wrong on that.  The origional statue was enormous.  It is too bad that the buildings of the fair were lost as they were not permanent structures. The largest building was around 26 acres (or maybe 13...I get my facts confused at times).  Far behind the replica statue is the University of Chicago campus, where there are two additional intersting statues.  One is the statue commemerating the first controlled &quot;splitting of the atom&quot; by Fermi and the other is called the &quot;Staute of Time&quot;...I believe...that was featured on some movie.", "authorname": "supersunny2009", "id": "3064182-2785068208-72157616161878577", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2785068208/#comment72157617746645659", "realname": "Luke Krzysztofiak", "path_alias": "agent_luke", "author": "37108607@N07", "iconserver": "2526", "datecreate": "1241723198", "_content": "Great archive.\nHere is a mini one I took a shot of in Chicago's River North Neighborhood\n<a href=\"http://tr.im/kLhm\">tr.im/kLhm</a>", "authorname": "Agent_Luke", "id": "3064182-2785068208-72157617746645659", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2785068208/#comment72157623836949512", "realname": "Umit Ucar", "path_alias": "ucarumit", "author": "61889238@N00", "iconserver": "74", "datecreate": "1271055981", "_content": "Nice follow up.", "authorname": "Umit Ucar", "id": "3064182-2785068208-72157623836949512", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2785068208/#comment72157624426879973", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ca_newsom", "author": "8505310@N04", "iconserver": "2404", "datecreate": "1279727019", "_content": "Satellite view:\n<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=hyde+park+chicago&amp;ie=utf8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=hyde+park,+illinois&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=wxrhtp3yb8linafwz436aw&amp;ved=0cceq8gewaa&amp;ll=41.779628,-87.579925&amp;spn=0.000583,0.001157&amp;t=h&amp;z=20\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com/maps?q=hyde+park+chicago&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;...</a>", "authorname": "Craig Newsom", "id": "3064182-2785068208-72157624426879973", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2785068208"}}
