Look at old (and modern) photographs of St Ouen and you'll see that it's taller and the design of the triforium and apse quite different. Besides, S Ouen still has all (I think) of its medieval stained glass, and also its 1890 Cavaill\u00e9-Coll organ and was never in such a ruinous state. Furthermore, I'm not sure about the date 1910 - unless this building was ruined in the Revolution, it would have to have been ruined in the war of 1914-18. That is unless there were churches ruined in the Franco-Prussian war...", "authorname": "Richard Harrold", "id": "3064182-2788174218-72157628676405133", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2788174218/#comment72157628708393771", "realname": "Brooklyn Museum", "path_alias": "brooklyn_museum", "author": "83979593@N00", "iconserver": "7330", "datecreate": "1325643527", "_content": "Hi Richard, \nWe'll take a look at the label on actual image and make sure that we transcribed it correctly. There are also quite a few other S. Ouen images in the collection that we can compare this to and see if it matches. Then some historical research ay be in order. This may take a while, but we'll get back to you when we have some more info to offer.\nThanks for the comment (I love a puzzle)!\nDeb Wythe\nDigital Lab", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-2788174218-72157628708393771", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2788174218/#comment72157629488340897", "realname": "Brooklyn Museum", "path_alias": "brooklyn_museum", "author": "83979593@N00", "iconserver": "7330", "datecreate": "1330609661", "_content": "Hi Richard,\nWell, it took us a while, but our Archivist did the research and identified this image  and several others as  Abbey of Notre Dame (Oise), Chiry-Ourscamp, not  St. Ouen, Rouen, as ID'd on the original photos. I'm finally updating them -- many thanks for giving us the heads up on this.\nDeb Wythe\nDigital Lab", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-2788174218-72157629488340897", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2788174218"}}
