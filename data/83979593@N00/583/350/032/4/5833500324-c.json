I couldn't find any news reports of Coney Island fires in 1902, although <a rel=\"nofollow\">Jeffrey Stanton</a> notes a huge one in 1903 (&quot;the Bowery from Steeplechase's entrance to Feltman's was completely consumed in flames&quot;). There was a silent film made about the 1903 fire, <a rel=\"nofollow\">The Great Fire Ruins, Coney Island</a> -- would love to see that and compare, but haven't found anything except listings on the web so far. Too bad!\n\nDeb Wythe\nDigital Lab", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-5833500324-72157626977248311", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "5833500324"}}
