We go with the information on the negative envelopes until research points us elsewhere. I found a <a href=\"http://www.westland.net/coneyisland/articles/lunapark.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"> ref</a> to the &quot;Fire and Flames shown in this photo that dates it to 1904:\n\n<i>Another illusion designed and staged by Thompson in 1904 was called Fire and Flames. It had its auditorium arranged that spectators were seated on the other side of the street from a burning four story building. Luna hired hundreds of firemen to fight imaginary flames. A rescue squad arrived to save men and women trapped in the building's top floors, who then jumped to safety into the nets below. Luna was the first park to present a live spectacular show, just barely beating Dreamland's similar show by weeks.</i>\n\nWe'll go with that (though it could certainly have been restaged in later years as well).\n\nThanks,\nDeb Wythe\nDigital Lab", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-5833500802-72157627154500410", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/5833500802/#comment72157627197615605", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "65892239@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1312117221", "_content": "This is wonderful.
