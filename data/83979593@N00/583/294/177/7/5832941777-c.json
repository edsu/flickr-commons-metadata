I appreciate the help.  It's been a bit of a headache trying to tweak the Google Maps GPS coordinates to the actual point(s) I have chosen.   Frequently in using Google Maps the coordinates seem to vary from the point chosen by approximately 50-100 yards at time.

Stay tuned (and feel free to geotag any you find in the mysteries set from the #mapBK project!)\n\nVery interesting blog! Hope you find grist for your painting mill among our images!\n\nDeb Wythe\nDigital Lab", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-5832941777-72157627092702858", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "5832941777"}}
