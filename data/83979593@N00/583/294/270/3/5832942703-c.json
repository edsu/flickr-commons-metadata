The shadow of the steeple is in the foreground. The church itself is not visible in the photo, which it should be if we were looking east from Ocean Avenue. The height from which the photo was taken is another cue: there were no other tall structures in the area at the time.", "authorname": "Flatbush Gardener", "id": "3064182-5832942703-72157627361808772", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5832942703"}}
