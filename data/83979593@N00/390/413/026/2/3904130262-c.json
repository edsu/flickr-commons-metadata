The coffin has remnants of gesso and gilding.  The 'teeth' that you see are really an artifact of the polychrome decoration and gilding - not actual teeth.  The cat mummy is inside the coffin, but for some reason (possibly because of thousands of years) the bundle has compressed, and the bones, and linens are a rather compact square form at the bottom of the coffin and are not visible in this x-ray view.
