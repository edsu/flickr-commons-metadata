It seems like this project has really struck a chord and gets people talking on a bunch of different issues.   For us, it was interesting to see these objects in a new way - I'm pretty familiar with these works and to see pieces of them at random where I least expect it is what surprises me and sort of gets me looking at these objects again.  Steve is working to find curators - he's aiming for a different show every two weeks, so I'm curious to see what comes next - you guys should curate a show in add-art :)  -s", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-2516812718-72157605219618627", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2516812718/#comment72157605220040055", "realname": "Tony Roberts", "path_alias": "preef", "author": "11118018@N00", "iconserver": "2842", "datecreate": "1211584373", "_content": "That's a really generous offer <img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/45/buddyicons/83979593@N00.jpg?1145886493#83979593@N00\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" /> , I think we should go for it! :)", "authorname": "Pickersgill Reef", "id": "3064182-2516812718-72157605220040055", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2516812718/#comment72157605220189133", "realname": "Topsy", "path_alias": "wygd", "author": "92784762@N00", "iconserver": "2388", "datecreate": "1211585164", "_content": "Hi Shelley, to tell you the truth, I am still in awe with the internet. It is such an amazing place that the few bits of advertising that I notice don't bother me. I do hate flashing adverts but I don't seem to come across them that often. In England I think you would be surprised how slow most people are to cotton onto the net. The vast majority of the artists in the studios at Waygood do not have broadband at home. Most of them do not really see the potential of the net!!! People use email but do not yet understand the real significance of what this technology has to offer. \n\nHow would we work with Steve to curate a show in add-art?", "authorname": "Topsy@Waygood", "id": "3064182-2516812718-72157605220189133", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2516812718/#comment72157605217256516", "realname": "Brooklyn Museum", "path_alias": "brooklyn_museum", "author": "83979593@N00", "iconserver": "7330", "datecreate": "1211593083", "_content": "Hi Topsy, contact Steve and he's got contact info listed here: <a href=\"http://add-art.org/content/contribute\">add-art.org/content/contribute</a> \n\nand some info about curating here:\n<a href=\"http://dev.eyebeam.org/projects/add-art/wiki/Curating\">dev.eyebeam.org/projects/add-art/wiki/Curating</a>", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-2516812718-72157605217256516", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2516812718/#comment72157605384064700", "realname": "Topsy", "path_alias": "wygd", "author": "92784762@N00", "iconserver": "2388", "datecreate": "1212388115", "_content": "OK.\nI have have made the necessary adjustments, removing all reference to BM and have contacted Steve.\nThank you for your assistance :)", "authorname": "Topsy@Waygood", "id": "3064182-2516812718-72157605384064700", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2516812718"}}
