The current mosque, which was erected in its place, was ordered by the Ottoman sultan Abd\u00fclmecid and built between 1854 and 1856. Its architects were Armenian father and son Garabet Amira Balyan and Nigo\u011fayos Balyan (who also designed the nearby Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace), who designed it in Neo-Baroque style. Within the mosque hangs several examples of Islamic calligraphy executed by the Sultan Abd\u00fclmecid himself, who was also a hattat (master calligrapher).\n\nThe wide, high windows let the ever-changing light reflections of the Bosphorus shine in the mosque.\n\nVikipedia", "authorname": "FlowerXP", "id": "3064182-2806281167-72157618855404516", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2806281167"}}
