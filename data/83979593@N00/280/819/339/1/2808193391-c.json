He died there in the side wing on February, 13th. \nLittle-known is that the Palazzo was leased by a second German. Karl Gustav Vollmoeller, an author and prosperous entrepreneur between the two World Wars, was a tenant of the Palazzo between 1919 and 1938, when the fascist administration confiscated his property (including a marvellous collection of exquisite furniture, carpets and paintings). Vollmoeller was a member of the circle of Stefan George and in 1929 the scriptwriter of the german movie &quot;Der Blaue Engel&quot; with Marlene Dietrich in her first leading role. He also was a talent seeker for Hollywood, where he died in 1948.", "authorname": "Lothar Balhorn", "id": "3064182-2808193391-72157623537581443", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2808193391"}}
