It's from an undated group of lantern slides that Professor Goodyear gathered to use for his lectures. His dates are 1846-1923; his work at the Brooklyn Institute and Brooklyn Museum started in 1890 -- so it's dated sometime in that period. Sorry not to be able to be more specific!\nFor more information about Goodyear and his work, follow the Goodyear Archival Collection link above and then click on &quot;finding aid.&quot;\nDeborah Wythe\nDigital Lab", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-2809041984-72157624303034490", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2809041984/#comment72157625622064853", "realname": "Elena Torelli", "path_alias": "elena_torelli", "author": "47957629@N06", "iconserver": "7424", "datecreate": "1294167097", "_content": "Hi, i'm from Corato, i can tell you something about it. \nI've also tryed to suggest a location to you but i haven't managed to do it. (By the way you can find Corato in the south of Italy near Bari, in the heel of the boot, Corato is in the hinterland.)\n\nAnyway, this is called &quot;Palazzo De Mattis&quot;, because it belonged to De Mattis' family, a noble family from Corato during the sixteenth century. It is located in the old part of the town, in the very centre of the town. This building is also called &quot;Palazzo delle pietre pizzute&quot; in our  own town dialect, which means Pointed/Sharped Stones Building&quot; or in current language &quot;Ashlar Building&quot;.\n\nI don't know if you needed these information, but i was very surprised to find something from my little city in such an important museum profile. :)", "authorname": "/ Elena Torelli", "id": "3064182-2809041984-72157625622064853", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2809041984/#comment72157625662304267", "realname": "Brooklyn Museum", "path_alias": "brooklyn_museum", "author": "83979593@N00", "iconserver": "7330", "datecreate": "1294621444", "_content": "Hi Elena,\n\nThanks for the information about this picture -- it is so helpful when we get in touch with someone who actually lives in the same place and can fill in our gaps in knowledge.
