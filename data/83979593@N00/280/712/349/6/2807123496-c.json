As the earliest complex, the Fatih Mosque was subsequently destroyed by earthquakes and completely rebuilt in a different style, the Beyazidye complex is thus of considerable historical and architectural significance.[1] Little is known about the architect other than that he also built a caravansary in Bursa; however, the polished style of the mosque itself indicates experience with earlier Ottoman and western architectural techniques.[2] The surrounding k\u00fclliye complex (madrasah, primary school, imaret (public kitchen) and hammam), date from 1501 to 1506.\n\nThe dome was partially rebuilt after an earthquake in 1509, and Mimar Sinan conducted further repairs in 1573\u201374. The minarets burned separately in 1683 and 1764. An inscription above the courtyard entrance suggests that repairs were also conducted in 1767.\n\nVikipedia", "authorname": "FlowerXP", "id": "3064182-2807123496-72157618855711432", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2807123496"}}
