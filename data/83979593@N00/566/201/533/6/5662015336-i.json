The central objects on my table are two large candelabras constructed from pennies and copper plumbing fittings.  There are also several smaller versions and some small nest sculptures made from barbed wire dispersed throughout the length of the table.  All of this is displayed on a table runner covered with silk screened \u201cGhetto Blaster\u201d imagery.  Each place setting has a silk screened model cassette which guests are allowed to take with them as a gift if they choose.\n \nThe <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/calendar/event/4128\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brooklyn Ball 2011</a> celebrates the art, creativity, and influence of Brooklyn artists and the Museum\u2019s role as a cultural gateway. This year\u2019s Ball is being designed in partnership with Brooklyn artists to create an evening filled with art, ideas, and surprises.\n\nFelicia Wong photo, Brooklyn Museum"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "428", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-04-27 11:39:40", "lastupdate": "1303990113", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1303926698"}, "originalsecret": "254b223460", "license": "2", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5301", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/5662015336/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
