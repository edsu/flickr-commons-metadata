Two allegorical sculptures created by Daniel Chester French, representing Brooklyn and Manhattan, were relocated to the Brooklyn Museum. My public art project brings contemporary replicas of the figures cast in translucent fiberglass resin, close to their original site, at the intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Tillary Street, where they spin and orbit in a perpetual dance above the street. By restoring art to the bridge's approach, this project addresses the original loss and the cultural climate that allowed it. In 1961, art on the Brooklyn side of the bridge was seen as an obstacle in the way of progress.\n\nMy table design consists of three pairs of candelabra inspired by my sculptural project on Flatbush Avenue.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/calendar/event/4128\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brooklyn Ball 2011</a> celebrates the art, creativity, and influence of Brooklyn artists and the Museum\u2019s role as a cultural gateway. This year\u2019s Ball is being designed in partnership with Brooklyn artists to create an evening filled with art, ideas, and surprises.\n\nFelicia Wong photo, Brooklyn Museum"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "522", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-04-27 12:44:39", "lastupdate": "1303990114", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1303926766"}, "originalsecret": "bc1330f084", "license": "2", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5187", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/5662018372/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
