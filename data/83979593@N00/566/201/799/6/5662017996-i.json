The tiny island sits between Coney Island and Staten Island.  Prior to its present usage by the seals, it was also, to a degree, a mating space for humans.  The former quarantine facility was closed down in 1911 after Arthur Denyse was brought up on charges that he and his fellow employees were conducting orgies in the office.  \n \nThis hand silk-screened tablecloth, designed for the Brooklyn Artists Ball, is based on 19th Century wallpaper patterns in fashion at this time of glory, featuring the island\u2019s present inhabitants.\n \nThe <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/calendar/event/4128\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brooklyn Ball 2011</a> celebrates the art, creativity, and influence of Brooklyn artists and the Museum\u2019s role as a cultural gateway. This year\u2019s Ball is being designed in partnership with Brooklyn artists to create an evening filled with art, ideas, and surprises.\n\nFelicia Wong photo, Brooklyn Museum"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "467", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-04-27 11:50:40", "lastupdate": "1303990114", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1303926758"}, "originalsecret": "82f232b0da", "license": "2", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5301", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/5662017996/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
