In addition, Hegarty has created a flock of crows that are attacking and decimating the recreated still lives.  Hegarty\u2019s insertion of the flock of crows humorously plays on the genre of vanitas painting, in which still lives contain objects that serve as symbolic reminders of life's impermanence (such as skulls, candles, or fruit showing signs of decay).  Often depicted in literature and paintings as harbingers of death, the crows activate the still lives at the same time as they serve to demolish the tableau.  The five still life paintings referenced are: Still Life with Peaches by Raphaelle Peale; Still Life with Cake also by Raphaelle Peale; Still Life, Fish by William Merritt Chase; Starfish by Marsden Hartley; and Pears and Oranges in a Bowl by William Glackens.  The work was created from a combination of epoxy, paint and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/calendar/event/4128\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brooklyn Ball 2011</a> celebrates the art, creativity, and influence of Brooklyn artists and the Museum\u2019s role as a cultural gateway. This year\u2019s Ball is being designed in partnership with Brooklyn artists to create an evening filled with art, ideas, and surprises.\n\nLisa Adang photo, Brooklyn Museum"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "988", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-04-26 00:00:04", "lastupdate": "1340643145", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1303904911"}, "originalsecret": "faacf08f80", "license": "2", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5109", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/5660548467/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
