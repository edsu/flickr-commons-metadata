With each of us producing half of the objects the contrast between our individual approaches broadens the range of shapes but also reveals commonalities and links between our practices and the disparate subjects. Themes such as figurative, linear, and geometric abstraction are prevalent and a span of universal symbols is created through the sequencing of changing forms. The collection of objects has a tie to the myriad of antiquities and remnants on view at the Museum and will bring to mind the process of assembling and displaying cultural artifacts in a manner that invites inquisition. \n\nIt is our intention for each person at the table to have an object in front of them so they can consider it throughout the evening. This will bring an aspect of juxtaposition between the object and the viewer that is immediate and direct. As a total composition, the display encourages guests to consider how objects exist simultaneously as elements of a universal symbolic language that is continuously evolving throughout history and as discreet embodiments of a distinct time and place, whether current or past.  \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/calendar/event/4128\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brooklyn Ball 2011</a> celebrates the art, creativity, and influence of Brooklyn artists and the Museum\u2019s role as a cultural gateway. This year\u2019s Ball is being designed in partnership with Brooklyn artists to create an evening filled with art, ideas, and surprises.\n\nLisa Adang photo, Brooklyn Museum"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "531", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-04-26 00:00:07", "lastupdate": "1309966653", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1303904888"}, "originalsecret": "b541d8117d", "license": "2", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5308", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/5660547827/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
