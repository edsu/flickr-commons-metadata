Each guest will take part in the degradation of the work by the simple act of enjoying the feast upon tablecloths carrying impressions of my body and each guest will be given parts of the centerpiece, which is comprised of bricks and bundles, fabric and collage, ribbon and paint, as representations of the wealth I have to offer.\n \nThe <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/calendar/event/4128\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brooklyn Ball 2011</a> celebrates the art, creativity, and influence of Brooklyn artists and the Museum\u2019s role as a cultural gateway. This year\u2019s Ball is being designed in partnership with Brooklyn artists to create an evening filled with art, ideas, and surprises.\n\nFelicia Wong photo, Brooklyn Museum"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "542", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-04-27 11:43:09", "lastupdate": "1304028077", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1303926778"}, "originalsecret": "566622095f", "license": "2", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5227", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/5661452131/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
