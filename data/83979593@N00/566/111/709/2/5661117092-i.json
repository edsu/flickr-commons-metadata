Elaborate ceremonies honor, idealize and purify the subject as they transition from one life chapter to the next.  The subject simultaneously embodies a climax and demise.  A new identity is conceived.  An old identity dies.  In this body of work, elements of ceremonial adornment are partnered with processes of decay.  Satin ribbons and flowers are fixed in a stilled state of destruction and removal inspired by fire or mold.  Through consumption and repurposing, each process re-imagines the beauty and energy of change and loss. \n \nBurial Feast is an elaborate spread composed of four paper casts of my body that are sprouting with flickering candelabras.  They are adorned with birthday cake-like mounds of fabric flowers and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 balloons.  A patchwork tablecloth is made from antique bedspreads.  Fabric flowers and crochet doilies are spread between the figures and around the table settings.  Eggs, human organs and vessels encrusted with broken jewelry are scattered throughout.  \n \nBurial Feast is visually and conceptually linked to Vadis Turner's current exhibition, Burial Party, at Lyons Wier Gallery through May 7th.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/calendar/event/4128\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brooklyn Ball 2011</a> celebrates the art, creativity, and influence of Brooklyn artists and the Museum\u2019s role as a cultural gateway. This year\u2019s Ball is being designed in partnership with Brooklyn artists to create an evening filled with art, ideas, and surprises.\n\nLisa Adang photo, Brooklyn Museum "}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "679", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-04-26 00:00:12", "lastupdate": "1309966653", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1303904917"}, "originalsecret": "2f31c3af21", "license": "2", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5308", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/5661117092/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
