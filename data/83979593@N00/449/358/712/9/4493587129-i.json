In a broader sense, I act as an advocate for the visitor and uphold our mission of being the most visitor-friendly museum.\n\n<strong>What is the funniest or most interesting experience you've had while working here? </strong>\n\nProbably the funniest, and most bizarre, thing I've done was at the closing of <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/murakami/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>\u00a9MURAKAMI</em></a>. It was a really long and intensive exhibition in terms of the crowds so, as a reward, I promised my staff I would gallop around the Visitors Center on my toy pony. So after we made our last ticket sales, I hopped on the pony and did several rounds while making horse noises, much to the amusement of my staff (and myself).\n\n<strong>What's your favorite work of art at the Museum? </strong>Georgia O'Keefe's <em><a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/115216/Green_Yellow_and_Orange/set/d2b2052d4d1d2a11c1fb1765dbe169d5?referring-q=georgia+o'keefe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green, Yellow, and Orange</a>.</em>\n\n<strong>What's your commute like? </strong>\n\nIt's a pleasant walk through Prospect Park. In the summer I even take off my shoes and walk through the grass (Hey, I'm from California . . .).\n\n<strong>What was your last job before the Museum? </strong>\n\nI was a manager at J. Crew.\n\n<strong>What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong>\n\nA pet psychologist.\n\n<strong>Do you have any hidden talents?</strong>\n\nI'm actually an excellent packer. In fact, I practice pack: I fully pack my suitcase, then take everything out, so I can finalize what I'm actually going to take. And when I'm in the security line at the airport, I always have a game plan prepared for getting through as quickly as possible. It's something akin to George Clooney's character in <em>Up in the Air</em>."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1530", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-03-18 13:07:29", "lastupdate": "1289538827", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1270488371"}, "originalsecret": "4868b19187", "license": "2", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4001", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/4493587129/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
