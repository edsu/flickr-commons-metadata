How the earth changes.  One school of opinion notes that the Sphinx was built much back further in history.  The theory was presented, it was built when Egypt was a lush tropical area.  I've seen images containing evidence of heavy water erosion on the monument walls, and base areas, along with later wind erosion.  This lush tropics 'might' have existed even more than 10,000 years ago...  Your image reminded me of this theory - of a land where moisture and green jungle like plant life was the rule, not sand and drought.    These ancient rivers and streams illustrate a moisture filled landscape template, very clearly.   One wonders what it must've looked like, when and what happened to change the land so much.  Congrats...great photo catch....  Super time travel.
