We usually see them perched on wires, but this one decided to pose on a Sakhmet statue for me.\n\n\n-<a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/author/mckercherm/\">Mary McKercher</a>\n\n\n______________________________\n\n<b>About the Mut Expedition</b>\n\nSince 1976, the Brooklyn Museum has been carrying out archaeological work at the Temple Precinct of the Goddess Mut (pronounced &quot;Moot&quot;) at South Karnak, an important religious site for almost two thousand years. The Mut Precinct is perhaps best known for its statues of Sakhmet, many of which are now housed in museums (including the Brooklyn Museum). Hundreds of these statues remain within the Precinct's walls. The Museum's team, which has shared the site with an expedition from Johns Hopkins University since 2001, continues to explore how the Mut Precinct grew and what its inscriptions reveal about ancient Egyptian religion and life. Both expeditions are also devoted to the conservation and restoration of the site's monuments. \n\nMore information at the Brooklyn Museum <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/features/mut/\">website</a>.\n\nMore Mut photos in this <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/collections/72157600001028735/\">Flickr Collection</a>.\n\nRead the <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/tag/digdiary2008\">Dig Diary 2008</a>!"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "655", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2008-01-03 10:41:30", "lastupdate": "1311634475", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1199716333"}, "originalsecret": "2aa09888c3", "license": "0", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2025", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2175451782/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
