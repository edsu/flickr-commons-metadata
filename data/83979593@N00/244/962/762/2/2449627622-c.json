Ticketed exhibitions have also been presented from time to time, usually when a show costs much more than the typical suggested admission we charge would even begin to cover.   We simply could not afford to offer free admission for a show that requires significant revenue to support.  We do offer a discounted First Saturday price of $5, which is 50% off of the $10 ticket price.  \n\nAlisa Martin, Visitor Services", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-2449627622-72157604969206767", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2449627622"}}
