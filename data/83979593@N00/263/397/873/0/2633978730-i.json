A while back I opened two boxes from the collection of the Library's special collections simply marked, \u201cBookplates\u201d. It was a collection of miscellaneous bookplates dating from the 1770\u2019s to the 1940\u2019s. These bookplates are created in a variety of media including etchings, engravings, linoleum blocks and woodcuts. This collection was donated to the Museum over the years when the Print Department was actively collecting and exhibiting examples of printing. Unfortunately, most of the bookplates in this collection are not signed by the artist, but can only be identified by the owner of the bookplate.\n\nRead Keith's <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/2008/07/03/little-treasures-from-the-past/\">blog post</a>."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2043", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2007-12-19 16:53:47", "lastupdate": "1290820903", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1215092170"}, "originalsecret": "9df4e80e4c", "license": "0", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3037", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/2633978730/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
