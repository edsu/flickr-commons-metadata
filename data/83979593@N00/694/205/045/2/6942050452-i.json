This resulted in what some perceive as an environmental disaster.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, April 18, 2012, the Brooklyn Museum will host its annual fundraising gala, the Brooklyn Artists Ball. This year\u2019s ball will celebrate women artists and recognize the fifth anniversary of the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. Guests will dine at table environments created for the occasion by sixteen Brooklyn women artists selected by the Museum\u2019s curators. Each artist will transform a 40-foot-long table into a new work of art that will be on view for one night only.\n\nBrooklyn Artists Ball\nApril 18, 2012\n<a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/calendar/event/5132\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.brooklynmuseum.org/calendar/event/5132</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "811", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2012-04-17 13:47:04", "lastupdate": "1387221560", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1334688926"}, "originalsecret": "476943d64e", "license": "2", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7220", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/6942050452/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
