The artist incorporates and absorbs imagery from other cultures in order to reflect, as he states, \u201cthe changing/shifting nature of British cultural identity and the fear these changes often evoke.\u201d He makes reference to the coats of arms of Caribbean countries\u2014national icons that, although derived from European traditions, incorporate symbols of native peoples\u2019 arts and environments. Here Locke interweaves designs from various works displayed in the Brooklyn Museum\u2019s collection, including the Paracas Textile and Nasca pots originating from Peru and African masks. The image at the center of this intricate design is a direct reference to a work in the collection by the French sculptor Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux titled A Negress (1868), which was an ethnographic study for the personification of Africa in a fountain of the four continents in the Luxembourg Gardens. According to Locke, his work \u201csymbolizes layers of history that have impacted British cultural identity.\u201d\n\nTamara's <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/2007/08/01/let-the-countdown-begin/\">Blog Post</a>\n\nUploaded for <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/visualstory/\">Tell a story in 5 frames</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1267", "farm": 2, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2007-08-17 21:10:40", "lastupdate": "1373590163", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1189773897"}, "originalsecret": "ae1732af80", "license": "0", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "1296", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/1380344948/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
