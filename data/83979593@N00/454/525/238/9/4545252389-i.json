These installations were inspired by a handful of seminal works by some of the most iconic artists of the twentieth century, all in some way depictions of the act of making art: Vito Acconci\u2019s Seedbed (1972); Marcel Duchamp\u2019s Fountain (1917); Bruce Nauman\u2019s Ten Heads Circle/Up and Down (1990); Paul McCarthy\u2019s Painter (1995); Jackson Pollock\u2019s One: Number 31 (1950); Joseph Beuys\u2019 How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare (1965); and Andy Warhol\u2019s Self-Portrait (1986).\n\nRubell asks you to engage in a simultaneously creative and destructive act, continually altering the physicality of each installation by touching, drinking, and eating it. You can and must interact with these installations in order to have a meal.\n\nThe project as a whole functions on many different levels: not only as a meal but also as a commentary on performance, self-portraiture, and art making; as a meeting place between the ephemeral and the monumental; as an exploration of ways to engage art history through a medium virtually absent from it; as a catalyst for a working interaction between viewers, objects, and the Museum; and as a questioning of the boundary between art and all that exists to support it."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "541", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-04-22 19:50:06", "lastupdate": "1272032922", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1272031679"}, "originalsecret": "eb0e137d47", "license": "2", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4035", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/4545252389/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
