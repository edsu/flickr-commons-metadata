Touching on notions surrounding the confluence of the built and natural worlds, debates over Nature vs. Nurture and the assimilation of the \u201cother\u201d, Ms. Hart creates an allegory inspired by her son\u2019s namesake, the Starling. Starlings were first introduced into Central Park by the American Acclimitization Society in an attempt to bring every bird species mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare's to North America. This resulted in what some perceive as an environmental disaster.

This year\u2019s ball will celebrate women artists and recognize the fifth anniversary of the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. Guests will dine at table environments created for the occasion by sixteen Brooklyn women artists selected by the Museum\u2019s curators. Each artist will transform a 40-foot-long table into a new work of art that will be on view for one night only.\n\nBrooklyn Artists Ball\nApril 18, 2012\n<a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/calendar/event/5132\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.brooklynmuseum.org/calendar/event/5132</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "841", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2012-03-26 07:15:23", "lastupdate": "1342381058", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1334074670"}, "originalsecret": "d6ef10345e", "license": "0", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7222", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/6918748984/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
