I checked with Jaap van Dijk, the expedition's resident bird expert, who says the bird is, indeed, a black-crowned night heron, not a kingfisher as the original title of this photo said. What makes the picture more interesting, according to Jaap, is that you rarely see these birds during the daytime -- and this photo was taken about noon. Thanks for the correction.  ~Mary", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-4443030059-72157623589117507", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "4443030059"}}
