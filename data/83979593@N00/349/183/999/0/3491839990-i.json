Department: Carpentry.\n\nPhotograph by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/obsessivephotography/\">Trish Mayo</a>.\n\nRecently, the Brooklyn Museum held a private showing of art produced by the Museum staff, featuring the work of over 50 artists from many different departments. For many of us, the experience of creating art is what drew us to work in an art museum. For others, to work alongside these world-class works of art is to be consistently inspired. Some of us identify first and foremost as artists, whereas others find art is something we create within the context of our personal and professional roles. In light of this, this showing was not curated\u2014each piece had been selected for inclusion by its creator.  \n\nAs we share this with our friends, family and Flickr-family, we hope that this body of work, when viewed collectively, provides a yet unseen glimpse of who we are as a community and as a Museum.
