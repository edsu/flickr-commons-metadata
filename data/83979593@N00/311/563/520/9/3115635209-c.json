And let's hear it for DSL at home and even faster connections at work. Things have changed a lot since we started all of this digitization about 10 years ago.\nGlad you liked the video. It was a fun presentation to put together. The Goodyear pics we have on the Commons are awesome and I'm tickled that so many people can now see them.\nHappy New Year,\nDeb", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-3115635209-72157625715829320", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "3115635209"}}
