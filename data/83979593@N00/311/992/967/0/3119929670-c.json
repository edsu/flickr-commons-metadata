Many thanks for all the feedback - it surprised us and helps us move forward.\n\nMost people wanted to see the Street Scenes and Panoramas, followed by the Museums and Art set, followed almost equally by Turkey and Pompeii sets.  Turns out, when we looked - Street Scenes and Panoramas are all street scenes of Turkey, so that set is has been renamed and will be released today.  \n\nNext, we carefully looked at Museums and Art and realized there are still a few things we have to talk about internally before we release that material.  Goodyear was shooting when he visited other museums and, while it is fascinating, the institutions in the shots probably need a heads up before we release that set - we are working on it, but it may be a while (sorry for the tease).\n\nSince we are releasing Turkey: Street Scenes, we decided to release the related Turkey: Mosques, given that it was also pretty high on your list.\n\nSo, with that:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/sets/72157607108722586/\">Turkey: Street Scenes</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/sets/72157607001883401/\">Turkey: Mosques</a>\n\nMany thanks to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dopiaza/\">dopiaza</a> for giving us a tool to batch move all these cloaked images to the top of our feed!\n\nAlso, be sure to check out <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/2009/01/12/the-world-through-goodyear%e2%80%99s-eyes-photographs-from-the-1890%e2%80%99s-to-1923-from-the-brooklyn-museum-archives/\">Deirdre's post in the Brooklyn Museum blog</a> - she just posted today about some additional history related to Goodyear.\n\nThanks,\n\nShelley \nChief of Technology", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-3119929670-72157612485131590", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/3119929670/#comment72157614895988271", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jasmike215", "author": "31042740@N00", "iconserver": "2749", "datecreate": "1236519776", "_content": "I would be very interested in seeing the Italian sets!!!", "authorname": "James Hanlon", "id": "3064182-3119929670-72157614895988271", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3119929670"}}
