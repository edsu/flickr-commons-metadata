We had done a <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/william_wegman/william_wegman_audio_tour.php\">pilot</a> of cell phone tours for our Wegman show and found visitors really liked it.  You can sort of choose what you want to hear as you go instead of committing to an entire tour and having to lug the standard equipment throughout the visit.  Shifting to cell phones will also allow us to provide our <a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/podcasts/\">podcast</a> series in the galleries so visitors won't have to download before they come to the museum.  For the pilot, the exhibition happened to be in the one gallery that gets decent signal, but as we move forward we've got a sizable amount of cabling to do ;)\r\n\r\nSorry, xonesix, the roof is not open to the public :(  We had to make special arrangements just to do our survey.", "authorname": "Brooklyn Museum", "id": "3064182-346043368-72157594460899139", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/346043368/#comment72157594460973726", "realname": "Deborah", "path_alias": null, "author": "49383479@N00", "iconserver": "134", "datecreate": "1168007792", "_content": "Fabulous photo.
