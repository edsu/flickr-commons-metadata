Sarmiento, a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and currently trying to compile a book entitled &quot;Odd Fellows Fraternity: Brothers and Sisters Worldwide&quot;. Because the book will also serve as visual presentation of the organization, I am collecting various photos about Odd Fellows and Rebekahs and also their works of charity. In connection, I would like to ask permission from your good office if I could use your Odd Fellows and Rebekah photos for free for this educational project I am working on. I promise to give credit to your name or to the photo contributor if ever it will be published. Also, I would like to ask if you could e-mail me an unresized or the original softcopy version of this photo because copying it from the website will result to a blurry image when printed in book.  I might use this photo above if you approve.\n\nYour photos will be very helpful in showing visual history and 'up-to-date' charities of our organization. If you also have other photos of Odd Fellows, I hope you could mail or email me a copy. I hope for your positive approval and helpful response. Thank you and God Bless!\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nLouie Blake S.
