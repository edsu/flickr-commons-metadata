The one I have has a photo( sepia tone ) of a woman holding a white rose in her hand ( the leaves are tinted green, and part of her dress is tinted red ) . The button background has a floral design with yellow roses and green ferns, with the name R.B. Schiefner ( same as above ) and a copyright by Cruver Mfg. Co. Is there any way to possibly find out who this person was? I would also be interested in any info on R.B. Schiefner, and when the photo was taken ( or the button ordered ).
