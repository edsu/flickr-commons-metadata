During the Victorian era, young boys were dressed in dresses, most particularly when being photographed.  That this picture is from America a little late in the game shows how the U.S. was still culturally still copying the old world.  The lace he is wearing is a typical English Bedfordshire lace.  The lacemakers at that time were in a losing battle with machine made lace (some of which were spectacular!).  For Bedfordshire in particular, the lacemakers, while striving to simplify for speed (the hallmark of the machines), still kept the hallmarks of handmade which were numerous picots (tiny rings of thread at the edge of the lace) and woven leaves (called tallies), especially tallies rolled into 3D details.  These laces were well available to the US at the time.  So Mr. Eastman, a practicing photographer, probably had suits of clothing and bits of lace to please the proud mamas and have her little darling snapped to suit her dearest wish.  It's not possible to determine if the lace in the picture was handmade or machine made without close inspection.  I have some machine made Bedfordshire lace from that era that I at first thought was handmade, but in spite of the picots and the tallies, I eventually concluded was machine made. The telltale was some oddness in the weaving that betrayed the limited angles available to the machine for tensioning parts of the work.  Lace made by hand allows the worker to pull the threads in any direction or angle to get the work &quot;just so&quot;.", "authorname": "lacecrazy", "id": "7122330-2719970181-72157609161274443",
