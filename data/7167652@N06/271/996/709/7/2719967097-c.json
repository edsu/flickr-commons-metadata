At age fourteen she made her debut in Brooklyn as Amina in &quot;La Sonnambula,&quot; and a month later, in November, 1866, her New York City debut as Prascovia in &quot;L'Etoile du Nord.&quot; In the American premiere of Gounod's &quot;Romeo et Juliette&quot; (1867) she sang Juliette. Hauk debuted in Paris in 1869 and in London that same year. The soprano then appeared in Italian and German opera throughout Europe. Hauk was the first American Carmen (1878) and Manon (1885). Her voice became a mezzo-soprano of great strength and depth. Hauk's enormous repertory included approximately one hundred roles and she sang Carmen in four languages. &quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://www.picturehistory.com/product/id/21369\">www.picturehistory.com/product/id/21369</a>", "authorname": "elemsee", "id": "7122330-2719967097-72157608153593260", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2719967097/#comment72157608537945255", "realname": "", "path_alias": "joygant", "author": "93613481@N00", "iconserver": "2496", "datecreate": "1225461858", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/889472@N20/\">Victorian Photographic Portraits of People</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "nate'sgirl", "id": "7122330-2719967097-72157608537945255", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2719967097/#comment72157610759961262", "realname": "", "path_alias": "flandes", "author": "36246040@N00", "iconserver": "172", "datecreate": "1228480481", "_content": "\u00bfcomo puede tener esa cintura?", "authorname": "\u00dabeda y un cordero en Flandes", "id": "7122330-2719967097-72157610759961262", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2719967097/#comment72157611033763300", "realname": "", "path_alias": "raye_isom", "author": "31837087@N07", "iconserver": "4053", "datecreate": "1228962920", "_content": "I blame a cruel corset for the less than comfortable look on her face; what an inhumane practice that was.\nThe hip to waist ratio is aberrant.", "authorname": "Rayezor", "id": "7122330-2719967097-72157611033763300", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2719967097/#comment72157614014728078", "realname": "", "path_alias": "lauralemur", "author": "7912554@N05", "iconserver": "210", "datecreate": "1234889070", "_content": "What is she holding?", "authorname": "lauralemur (life is upsidedown right now)", "id": "7122330-2719967097-72157614014728078", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2719967097/#comment72157616326031149", "realname": "Brittney Ray", "path_alias": "muffy31776", "author": "36684109@N05", "iconserver": "3437", "datecreate": "1239006925", "_content": "Corsets actually aren't that uncomfortable if worn correctly, . . .", "authorname": "pond_ripple", "id": "7122330-2719967097-72157616326031149", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2719967097/#comment72157617725797544", "realname": "", "path_alias": "melissaxerzi", "author": "34762512@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1241525091", "_content": "a great picture!!!", "authorname": "melissaerziphotography", "id": "7122330-2719967097-72157617725797544", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2719967097/#comment72157622222147859", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "45705704@N00", "iconserver": "122", "datecreate": "1252768471", "_content": "Rayezor, as an opera singer she could ill afford to bow to fashion to the extreme some women did (even the possibility of endangering your lungs is horrifying to an opera singer; it's your whole livelihood!), and she almost certainly could have afforded the money to have her clothing custom made (which makes corsets very comfortable).
