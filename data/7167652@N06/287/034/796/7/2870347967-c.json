Born in Cornwall Township, Henry County, Illinois, he reached the majors in 1899. After a 10 year major league career he continued to pitch in the minor leagues, eventually bowing out of baseball for good at the age of 54, having amassed nearly 500 wins as a professional ballplayer. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_McGinnity\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_McGinnity</a>", "authorname": "amelia, you're breaking my heart", "id": "7122330-2870347967-72157609012612145", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "2870347967"}, "flarchive:created": 1387755593}
