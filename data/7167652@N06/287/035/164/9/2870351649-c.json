McIntyre joined the Tigers in 1904 and was a 26-year old starter when 18-year old Cobb joined the team in 1905. Early in Cobb's rookie season, Cobb went after a flyball that was clearly in McIntyre's left field territory. By cutting in front, Cobb caused McIntyre to drop the ball, infuriating McIntyre. McIntyre was a Connecticut Yankee who had little in common with the taciturn kid from Georgia. McIntyre and his cohorts led a prolonged hazing campaign, locking Cobb out of an empty washroom, flicking food at Cobb, and nailing his shoes to the clubhouse floor. Cobb's legendary temper only added fuel to the fire, and the McIntyre-Cobb feud continued until McIntyre was sold to the White Sox after the 1910 season.\n\n(from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matty_McIntyre)\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matty_McIntyre)</a>", "authorname": "amelia, you're breaking my heart", "id": "7122330-2870351649-72157609012643303", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2870351649/#comment72157611021060411", "realname": "", "path_alias": "victor98_2001", "author": "30444654@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1229006360", "_content": "great shot", "authorname": "victortan47", "id": "7122330-2870351649-72157611021060411", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2870351649/#comment72157613176586056", "realname": "", "path_alias": "aheart", "author": "34469860@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1233378133", "_content": "big ears!", "authorname": "A-HEART", "id": "7122330-2870351649-72157613176586056", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2870351649/#comment72157622115331421", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "42173552@N04", "iconserver": "2656", "datecreate": "1252077797", "_content": "This photo must be from 1901.
