St. Paul, operated by the American Line, was built in Philadelphia at the William Cramp &amp; Sons shipyard and launched in 1895. She was the identical sister ship of the S.S. St. Louis, launched in 1894. (<a href=\"http://www.oceanliners.us/catalog/item/919557/487403.htm\">Related web page</a>.)\n\nOn board the St. Paul, on November 15, 1899, Guglielmo Marconi issued The Transatlantic Times, the first newspaper ever published  at sea, using information received by radio transmission from his wireless telegraph station on the Isle of Wight. (<a href=\"http://www.iwbeacon.com/The-Isle-of-Wight--the-Birth-of-Radio.aspx\">Related web page</a>.)\n\nIn 1908, the St. Paul was involved in a collision with the British cruiser HMS Gladiator, which sank but was later raised and scrapped. (<a href=\"http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/hms_gladiator.htm\">Related web page</a>.)\n\nIn 1918, the St. Paul was purchased by the U.S. government, but keeled over at the pier in New York Harbor while undergoing conversion for military use and never saw service. Apparently, she was salvaged and returned to private operation, as I found a reference to poet John Allan Wyeth taking passage to Europe aboard her in 1920.
