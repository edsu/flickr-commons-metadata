It looks very much like the  <a href=\"http://www.chryslerclub.org/memberphotos3.html\">DP Deluxe Sedan on this page</a>.  1933 was the last year in which all Dodge models had vertical hood louvers. The only 1934 sedan with vertical louvers I can find on the Internet is <a href=\"http://www.canberrarodandkustomklub.org/Photos/dodge.JPG\">this one</a>, and it has a different style of bumper than the car Muray photographed. Here's <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/kenmojr/2725419032/in/photostream/\">another 1934</a> with the scooped bumper, but featuring horizontal hood louvers.\n\nAs can be seen from the Dodges on <a href=\"http://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/dodge-cars.html\">this page</a>, by 1935 their cars were a bit less boxy, as designers moved toward streamlining, and the radiator caps had been concealed under the hoods. Also, the front doors no longer opened backward. Interestingly, Dodge's <a href=\"http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1935-dodge-kc-half-ton-pickup.htm\">small trucks</a> continued to sport the straight bumpers and vertical louvers as late as 1935.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "7122330-3123697036-72157611469503422", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/3123697036/#comment72157611527057021", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "15283643@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1230132022", "_content": "Super photo!

The car has a nitrocellulose lacquer finish (dark maroon?) with lots of decorative striping in a contrasting color.
