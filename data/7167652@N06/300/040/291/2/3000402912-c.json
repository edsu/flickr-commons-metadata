But many people in the region were still attached to France (there was a little something related to republic, or revolution, or democracy... why would people woud like that ??? ;) ), and the rest of french people resented the german for this 'annexion'.\nEssentially, the main french motive for the WW I was to gain back Alsace &amp; Lorraine.\n\nThis postcard shows a young alsacian girl, comforted by a french soldier, telling her : &quot;Forget prussian (=german) rulers/oppression, it's so good to live in your home place (=France)&quot;\nAt their feet, one can see the german border sign of the time, signifiying re-unification.
