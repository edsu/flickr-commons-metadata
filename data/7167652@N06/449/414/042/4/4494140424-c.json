There is no indication that the flag pole is up against a backdrop.

If it was a canvas backdrop and that corner was the edge they would have had to gone to great lengths to cut out the canvas around the rocks. The shadow behind the flagpole that looks like a shadow on a backdrop is actually the ghosting of the moving flag during the long exposure. It isn't a lance leaning against the backdrop. Other things to consider is why would they do it and the backdrop would have had to been enormous.

As for expert comments, maybe you didn't notice that The George Eastman House has made a comment here on this photograpgh which is in their collection. I thank them for that and for the discussion that took place here.\nI do object to your inference that Flickr users could not be qualified to make comments. So you know everyone's background, experience and education? I was not being pretentious, I was making an observation, which is not out of line. That is the wonderful and also qestionable thing about photographs past and present, they are not always what they appear to be.\nIf you are familiar with the photographs of the Canadian photographer William Notman, who was photographing in the late 1800s, you will know that it is possible to take &quot;outdoor&quot; photographs in a studio. He made wonderful photos, portraits of people in wintery scenes that were studio set-ups with backdrops, fake snow. etc. His intention was to chronicle life in Canada.
