Black servants did in fact raise several generations of white children.  Children came to regard their caretakers kindly (in many cases) and might even regard their caretakers with the same affection held for their very own parents.\nAlso, quite a few people had black servants and they certainly were not rich.  If the family were rich the background and floor would have been clean and formal.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.historybroker.com/slavery/slave5.jpg\">www.historybroker.com/slavery/slave5.jpg</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://lemonandlime.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/slave-with-family.jpg\">lemonandlime.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/slave-with-famil...</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.historybroker.com/slavery/slave6a.jpg\">www.historybroker.com/slavery/slave6a.jpg</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3251/2723653939_0ab99f2d99_o.jpg\">farm4.static.flickr.com/3251/2723653939_0ab99f2d99_o.jpg</a>\n\nPhotographs of this era are generally looked upon as a formal/semi-formal event,  which generally meant not smiling.\nIt is more likely they are not smiling, however, because the exposure time involved in the photographic process was rather lengthy (between 5 and 15 minutes) and the subject wouldn't be able to hold a smile for such a long time without the photo blurring, which explains the dog's slightly blurred appearance.  Most of us know how hard it is to get pets to keep still for modern photographs with flash let alone any that had a lengthy exposure time. \n\nThe top button on the man's jacket remains buttoned to retain some element of formality, the rest of the buttons may be undone when a person is seated.  If you watch people today who wear a suit jacket notice what they do just before they sit down...they unbutton the jacket.  It could also depend on the formality of the picture, the formality of the subject or the person who paid to have the photograph taken...everyone is a little different:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.photographymuseum.com/tuskeglg.jpg\">www.photographymuseum.com/tuskeglg.jpg</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://highway55.library.yale.edu/SIMPSONIMG/size3/D0019/1009628.jpg\">highway55.library.yale.edu/SIMPSONIMG/size3/D0019/1009628...</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://highway55.library.yale.edu/SIMPSONIMG/size3/D0032/1022015.jpg\">highway55.library.yale.edu/SIMPSONIMG/size3/D0032/1022015...</a>", "authorname": "LMangue", "id": "7122330-2720789660-72157613558493023", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2720789660/#comment72157614383473324", "realname": "Carlos Grand", "path_alias": null, "author": "30568835@N08", "iconserver": "3196", "datecreate": "1235487734", "_content": "<b> Un excelente B/N!!!\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3068/2555012003_48948e0bc1_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"193\" />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/753665@N21/\">\nB/N,La Critica Constructiva</a></b>", "authorname": "Carlos Grand", "id": "7122330-2720789660-72157614383473324", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2720789660/#comment72157614474272728", "realname": "Criz Stoddard", "path_alias": "zyrc", "author": "16333811@N00", "iconserver": "36", "datecreate": "1235672978", "_content": "This image has been used in the indicommons.org post: <a href=\"http://www.indicommons.org/2009/02/19/black-history-across-the-commons-part-1/\">Black History across the Commons - Part 1</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://indicommons.org/\"><img src=\"http://indicommons.org/images/indicommonsURL.png\" alt=\"indicommons.org badge\" /></a>", "authorname": "zyrcster", "id": "7122330-2720789660-72157614474272728", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2720789660/#comment72157615080679264", "realname": "Carlos Goul\u00e3o", "path_alias": "cgoulao", "author": "69785329@N00", "iconserver": "5455", "datecreate": "1236724747", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1015090@N24/\">Vintage Animals / Imagens Antigas de Animais</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "CGoulao", "id": "7122330-2720789660-72157615080679264", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2720789660/#comment72157615521338019", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "36514831@N07", "iconserver": "3473", "datecreate": "1237466353", "_content": "Que bonita <img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3593/3366952895_63364af2b5_m.jpg\" />", "authorname": "hirsute91", "id": "7122330-2720789660-72157615521338019", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2720789660/#comment72157615724647924", "realname": "carlosbezz", "path_alias": "artlandstudio", "author": "22694125@N02", "iconserver": "7427", "datecreate": "1237655044", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1087739@N22/\">streetdog</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "artland", "id": "7122330-2720789660-72157615724647924", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2720789660/#comment72157616022871248", "realname": "Kathy Maximo", "path_alias": "vintagesnapsandscraps", "author": "21136078@N06", "iconserver": "2417", "datecreate": "1238248704", "_content": "This is a heart warming photo and I am so happy to have found it to look at.

Look at other photos from the same year / decade and you'll see a lot of men wearing their jackets so buttoned when seated. It was commonplace.\n\n<em>The child's complexion is the same colour as her / his outfit.</em>\n\nNo. This is a monochrome photograph and colors reflecting comparable amounts of light are rendered as tones close in luminance value.\n\n<em>The ground appears to be littered with leaves and debris of some sort - if this were a portrait would it not have been taken indoors?</em>\n\nYes. Photography studios at the time deliberately placed leaves and debris on the floor to create the illusion of an outdoor setting.\n\n<em>The dog does appear to have some blurring around its head, almost as if it has moved as the picture is being taken, but its body is perfectly still.</em>\n\nNo blurring is evident around or of the dog's head. Examine the largest size and the dog's head can be seen to have been rendered as sharply as the man and the child.\n\n<em>Neither the man or the child have a &quot;posed&quot; expression on their faces, not a smile nor a &quot;serious&quot; look usual to this type of photograph.</em>\n\nThat's because film speeds at the time were sufficient to allow shutter speeds of around one second, so portrait sitters did not have to hold their expression for long.\n\nThere is a general misconception that all photographs made in the 19th century were subject to achingly slow shutter speeds measured in minutes. In the early days of photography (1830's -- 1850's)  Dageurreotypes required very long shutter speeds, but with the introduction of the Fox Talbotype (Ambrotype) negative-positive process, shutter speeds were relatively quick.\n\nNote that altho (although) the Dageurreotype was still in use, this photograph is not a Dageurreotype. It's an Ambrotype made on a glass plate negative.\n\n<em>Even if the photograph has been taken after the end of the Civil war such a pale white child leaning so comfortably against a black man must surely have been out of the ordinary</em>\n\nThis was kind of relationship was common. Even after blacks were manumitted many of them remained servants of white peeple (people), and it was normal for white children to form close frendships (friendships) with their black caretakers.\n\n@LMangue: <em>If the family were rich the background and floor would have been clean and formal.</em>\n\nNope. Photography studios at the time deliberately placed leaves and debris on the floor to create the illusion of an outdoor setting.\n\n<em>Photographs of this era are generally looked upon as a formal/semi-formal event, which generally meant not smiling.\nIt is more likely they are not smiling, however, because the exposure time involved in the photographic process was rather lengthy (between 5 and 15 minutes) and the subject wouldn't be able to hold a smile for such a long time without the photo blurring, which explains the dog's slightly blurred appearance.</em>\n\nNo, nonsense, read my explanation above. The main reason they're not smiling was portraiture style and the austere, stern social mores of the time. Peeple (people) just didn't smile in a portrait because photographic portraiture at this time still sought to emulate painted portraits in which sitters did not smile.
