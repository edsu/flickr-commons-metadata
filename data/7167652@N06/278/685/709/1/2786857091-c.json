Construction began in 1900 and the building was completed in 1907.  So I would suggest that this photo was taken closer to the year 1900 - rather than the &quot;ca. 1905&quot; date given.", "authorname": "neighborslva", "id": "7122330-2786857091-72157606948309461", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2786857091"}, "flarchive:created": 1387755682}
