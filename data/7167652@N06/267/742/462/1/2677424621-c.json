The neckline (trimmed with the lace Bertha) is too off the shoulder to be accurate, as shown by the extra shoulder straps making a more Edwardian neckline shape.  It's not clear if it is an Edwardian &quot;olde tyme style&quot; costume or an 1850s original that's been altered for fancy dress.  That V-shaped &quot;stomacher&quot; on the bodice front looks like it's crooked and that dark, heavy trim on a short-sleeved evening dress doesn't look right.", "authorname": "eurbach", "id": "7122330-2677424621-72157624711059686", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2677424621/#comment72157632937550276", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "64838194@N02", "iconserver": "7413", "datecreate": "1362619856", "_content": "It does look like a costume, which was popular back then.
