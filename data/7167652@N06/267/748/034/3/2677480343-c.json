The only difference in body appearance I can think of would be the effect of increased sun exposure to the skin (tighter, harder, more lines and creases).  In this era before radio, TV, and, especially, air conditioning, people generally  spent a lot more time outdoors and their skin reflected that fact.  Otherwise, we tend to see them as less attractive for extraneous reasons:  Their clothing seems odd to our modern sensibilities.  They had no botox, no breast implants.  I'm sure they had rudimentary make-up but nothing like what women use today.  Additionally there is the difference of cultural notions about &quot;sitting for your photograph.&quot;  There's hardly such a thing as a &quot;studio portrait&quot; in today's culture.  When we send pictures of ourselves today, we think more about looking cool, provocative, or in some way out of the ordinary.  In the 19th Century, sitting for a portait was a special event and subjects approached that event with a sense of dignity.  Most wore their Sunday best and tried to project an aura of seriousness appropriate for the occasion.  \n\nIf you look past all the superficial and artificial things we use to &quot;enhance&quot; our appearance, people are just as ugly today as they were back then.  Only today, we're fatter!", "authorname": "thetallguy747", "id": "7122330-2677480343-72157623585188167", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2677480343/#comment72157623588317871", "realname": "", "path_alias": "creative-girl", "author": "8638861@N02", "iconserver": "2713", "datecreate": "1269694850", "_content": "wow !!  tall guy... love your vocab and you got it bang on !", "authorname": "PAINT-GIRL", "id": "7122330-2677480343-72157623588317871", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2677480343/#comment72157623979326054", "realname": "Moira", "path_alias": null, "author": "47160936@N02", "iconserver": "2691", "datecreate": "1272851784", "_content": "Amen tallguy!
