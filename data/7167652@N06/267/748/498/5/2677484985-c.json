While I am not an era aficionado, I do believe they used a flat iron that they heated on the stove tops. Similar, if not the same, as the ones they used for their clothing. But... I could be wrong. And I do believe that they had 'stuff' they used to put in their hair, especially for occasions like this to keep the hold. If they could identify every leaf on the ground and know its healing properties then I am sure they knew what to stick under their armpits to 'relieve' everyone and what to boil into a dippity-do consistency to make their hair do ... I want to say odd things, but if they had ever seen some of the do's since their generation, they'd need vapors.
