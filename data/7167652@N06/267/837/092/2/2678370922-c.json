After the Bolshevik revolution (October 1917), when landmarks were renamed in honor of revolutionary heroes, the embankment was named after one of the leaders of the mutinies that took place among the sailors of  the Black Sea Fleet during the 1905 revolution (a subject made famous by Sergei Eisenstein\u2019s most famous film \u201cThe Battleship \u2018Potemkin\u2019\u201d \n<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015648/\">www.imdb.com/title/tt0015648/</a>\n\n\nThe photograph is dominated by a church and monastery with an interesting history. \n\nStarting in 1718 this site was the property of a number of different existing monasteries, intended for construction of an urban branch monastery, in Russian, a \u2018podvor\u2019e.\u2019 The first structures were built here in the 1730s. In 1874 the site was transferred to the Kievan Monastery of the Caves, which commissioned the church and monastery you see in the photograph. In 1894 architects V.A. Kosiakov and B.K. Pravdzik won a competition to design a new church complex. The Church of the Assumption of Holy Mother, was dedicated in 1897. The monastery and church was built in a nationalist style designed to resemble medieval religious architecture.\n\nIn 1935 the monastery was closed and the brothers were arrested. The icons were covered with plaster. The indoor ice-skating rink was built in 1956, the first to use artificial ice. In 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, restoration of the building and its interior paintings began.\n\nMore information (in Russian) can be found here\n<a href=\"http://walkspb.ru/zd/leit_shmidt27.html\">walkspb.ru/zd/leit_shmidt27.html</a>\n\nUnfortunately, virtually nothing is known about the photographer, Charles Chusseau-Flaviens.
