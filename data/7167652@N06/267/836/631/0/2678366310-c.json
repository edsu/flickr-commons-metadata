The Store was located at 243-253 Regent Street at the southwestern arc of Oxford Circus.  In this image we are looking northwest from the southwest corner of Regent and Oxford Streets.  Behind the policeman is Oxford Street and its intersection with John Prince's Street.\n\nThere are two reasons I believe that this image has proved hard to locate. The first reason is that the buildings we see in the background on either side of the Oxford Street/John Prince's Street intersection are now gone. The site of the one on the left at the northwest corner is now occupied by the modernist London College of Fashion building. The second reason is that the glass and sculpted-cast-iron, Art Nouveau  facade of the Jays shop storefront is different from the stone facaded of the building today.  \n\nIf you look at this image from the Museum of London website...\n<a href=\"http://www.museumoflondonprints.com/image/658969/unknown-busy-street-scene-at-oxford-circus-c-1900\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.museumoflondonprints.com/image/658969/unknown-busy-st...</a>\n...you can see the same two buildings on the north side of Oxford Street. Yes the angle is completely different, but you can still make out enough details of these buildings to determine that they are indeed the ones in the background of the photo above. \n\n Also is you compare the paving stones at the foot of the policeman in the image with how they look today you will see they have changed very little. Indeed, my guess is most of stones and the pattern itself is the same.\n\n<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.515526,-0.142908&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.515246,-0.142264&amp;spn=0.001068,0.005681&amp;sll=51.514933,-0.141999&amp;sspn=0.006295,0.006295&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=51.515246,-0.142267&amp;panoid=x-I6AFqujjOhWD4yuZLKbw&amp;cbp=11,150.6,,1,23.29\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com/maps?q=51.515526,-0.142908&amp;hl=en&amp;...</a>\n\nEric, SepiaTown Staff", "authorname": "SepiaTown", "id": "7122330-2678366310-72157627158808967", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "2678366310"}, "flarchive:created": 1387755907}
