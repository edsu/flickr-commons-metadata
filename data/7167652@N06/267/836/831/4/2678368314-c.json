The long veil indicates that she is a married lady.  This dress has the embroidery pattern seen on many of the court dresses worn by ladies in waiting to the Empress.  Since she is a married lady in waiting, the dress is made of green velvet, embroidered in gold.\n\nIt appears that she is wearing a brooch on her right shoulder which is probably the cipher of the Empress she serves.  I cannot enlarge the photo clearly enough to identify it.\n\n There is a very good article about the history of these &quot;Women's Uniforms&quot; here: \n<a href=\"http://www.alexanderpalace.org/palace/ctCostume.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.alexanderpalace.org/palace/ctCostume.html</a>", "authorname": "badkitty2006", "id": "7122330-2678368314-72157621402555307", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2678368314"}, "flarchive:created": 1387755892}
