The common elements were the head hugging cap itself, a large edging across the front, long tabs that hung down from the cap called lappets, sometimes a ruffled wide edging around the bottom.  These were Sunday best and worn on any occasion requiring one's &quot;best&quot; attire.  \n\nThe bonnets were made of whatever was available.  The laces were handmade or machine made (after about 1850).  Sometimes the wearer would make their own lace, sometimes they bought the laces.  Sometimes the laces were recycled pieces from clothing.  Embroidered parts were less likely to be bought.  \n\nMost of the laces used for bonnets didn't change much over time, so that it is very difficult to identify when they were made.", "authorname": "lacecrazy", "id": "7122330-2678305780-72157609905516662", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2678305780/#comment72157612411561146", "realname": "Maryam", "path_alias": "fridalicious", "author": "46209981@N00", "iconserver": "114", "datecreate": "1231629433", "_content": "Scary!", "authorname": "Masgara", "id": "7122330-2678305780-72157612411561146", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/2678305780/#comment72157613111105707", "realname": "Lucy", "path_alias": "lacrimosa_lucy", "author": "84465035@N00", "iconserver": "3734", "datecreate": "1233312202", "_content": "The hair appears rather too glossy and perfect for her age.
