The headlight on its roof along with what appears to be a exhaust stack, whistle and something else makes it possible. Hung on the side of the truck seems to be a steam cylinder with piston guides. It also could be a compressor. I leave this to the experts to say what it is. Self powered rail cars around 1865 were rare.", "authorname": "toptrain2100", "id": "7122330-5613618331-72157633853225940", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5613618331"}, "flarchive:created": 1387754612}
