Black is beautiful. Feminism. Pot &amp; a button that reads &quot;Stop breathing on my button&quot;\nUntil I saw this picture, I had never noticed how black women were relegated to the oblivion of womankind (and humankind). Look at all the other photos in this expo and you'll only find white women. Only white women were photo worthy. Only white women were teachers. Only white women served in the NAVY. Only white women were allowed to be sexy and a beauty pattern. Only white women were good enough for underwear advertisement. Only white women can be smart and avant-garde and break the barriers of manliness and sexism. Black women simply didn't exist. To make things worse, the first public portray of a black woman tries very hard to make her look like an outlaw, by associating her skin color with smoking pot and wearing rebelious apendages. The world has been unffair enough to women, but it went way beyond the limit of unffairness with non-white women.
