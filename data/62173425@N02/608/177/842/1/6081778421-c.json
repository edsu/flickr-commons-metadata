It was their only bus and they kept it until replacement by a new bus in 1931.\n\nI cannot make out the full registration of the bus in front on route 284 but it is from the 'Overground' fleet and all their XT-registered buses were Dennises. It is going all the way to Hadley Highstone, north of Barnet.\n\nThe covered top bus going the other way is a 'General' NS-type - the Metropolitan Police had only finally given permission for the operation of the covered top version at the beginning of 1926 following experimental operation the previous year, so this is an early one.", "authorname": "andrewcolebourne", "id": "62153077-6081778421-72157632346048332", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "6081778421"}, "flarchive:created": 1387640580}
