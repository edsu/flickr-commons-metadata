There are several photos of his shelter at the Queen's Hotel end of Navigation Street in Birmingham with its four lane passenger flow system but they are all taken at the other end, to the right, where there were two tracks which butted on to the end of the shelter.  The shelter was built c.1922-3 and had gone by the mid-1930s as Midland Red buses competed for terminal kerb space on th esame stretch of road after about 1935. The line in the foreground was just a stub used to park and sometimes load trams in the rush hour.  There was another similar shelter in the middle of Dale End just before the junction with Albert Street but here the trams loaded on either side of the shelter and was used by services to Nechells, Washwood Heath and Perry Barr.  It had a similar lifespan though perhaps it was removed about 1933.", "authorname": "dharveyindudley", "id": "62153077-8046429567-72157632697630698", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/stockholmtransportmuseum_commons/8046429567/#comment72157632709194246", "realname": "tockholm Transport Museum", "path_alias": "stockholmtransportmuseum_commons", "author": "62173425@N02", "iconserver": "6199", "datecreate": "1360226293", "_content": "Tram stop it is!", "authorname": "Stockholm Transport Museum Commons", "id": "62153077-8046429567-72157632709194246", "iconfarm": 7}], "photo_id": "8046429567"}, "flarchive:created": 1387640413}
