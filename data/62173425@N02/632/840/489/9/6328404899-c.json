I'll need to think hard if this is one of the reconstructed central area stations, where these replaced lifts, or one of the new extension stations (such as the Piccadilly line north of Finsbury Park in 1932/2). The design was wonderful - bronze toned metalwork, and varnished timber side panels, and those wonderful Charles Holden designed uplighters. Very few now survive on the system - the uplighters were sadly mostly removed in the 1970s and '80s but a few stations do still have them, including St Johns Wood and Southgate. The timber panels and step pallets were replaced, wholesale, following the tragic Kings Cross escalator fire of 1987 and subsequent new fire legislation.", "authorname": "mikeyashworth", "id": "62153077-6328404899-72157628090499950", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/stockholmtransportmuseum_commons/6328404899/#comment72157628099580988", "realname": "", "path_alias": "whyungbi", "author": "64723577@N07", "iconserver": "6220", "datecreate": "1320959708", "_content": "**great shot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "authorname": "WhyungBi", "id": "62153077-6328404899-72157628099580988", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/stockholmtransportmuseum_commons/6328404899/#comment72157627986189301", "realname": "", "path_alias": "imperfectionsmakeusperfect", "author": "65046975@N02", "iconserver": "6131", "datecreate": "1321115569", "_content": "Amazing", "authorname": "jacygrant", "id": "62153077-6328404899-72157627986189301", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/stockholmtransportmuseum_commons/6328404899/#comment72157628034312405", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "63913262@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1321599389", "_content": "beautiful composition. incredible shot", "authorname": "Vin Cin", "id": "62153077-6328404899-72157628034312405", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/stockholmtransportmuseum_commons/6328404899/#comment72157628258117879", "realname": "Mikey", "path_alias": null, "author": "36844288@N00", "iconserver": "7446", "datecreate": "1322909760", "_content": "The more I consider this it could be Leicester Square station, the escalators here went into service in early 1935.", "authorname": "mikeyashworth", "id": "62153077-6328404899-72157628258117879", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/stockholmtransportmuseum_commons/6328404899/#comment72157631108665234", "realname": "Fahad Saleh", "path_alias": "dewdrop-blueheart", "author": "48711585@N02", "iconserver": "4135", "datecreate": "1345191465", "_content": "fantastic shooot", "authorname": "Fahad blueheart", "id": "62153077-6328404899-72157631108665234", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/stockholmtransportmuseum_commons/6328404899/#comment72157632409688912", "realname": "", "path_alias": "howard33", "author": "62379908@N00", "iconserver": "2531", "datecreate": "1357094316", "_content": "I think the first escalator I saw in the US was 1951.
