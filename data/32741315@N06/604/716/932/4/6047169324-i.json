The featured miniature is one of twelve large miniatures in gold frames, arched at the top and with three or four lines of text underneath. This leaf signals the beginning of the Hours of the Holy Spirit and depicts the Feast of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples. The full border of ivy-leaf design incorporates at the top, a man with a club, and two wrestlers, and at the base of the border, three angels. Immediately below the miniature is a 3-line initial decorated in red and blue with white tracery on a gold ground. The second line of text is completed with a line-filler. \n\nThe Book of Hours was a medieval prayer book used by laymen for private devotion. These books were created for both men and women, but their place in female devotion is particularly noteworthy. The text centres on the Hours of the Virgin, a series of prayers to be said at the eight canonical hours of Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4815", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-02-17 14:46:52", "lastupdate": "1380766078", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1313440445"}, "originalsecret": "7d6369593d", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6070", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/6047169324/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
