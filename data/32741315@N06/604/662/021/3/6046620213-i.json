The miniature pictured is one of twelve large miniatures in gold frames, arched at the top and with three or four lines of text underneath. This leaf at the beginning of Sext for the Hours of the Virgin features the Adoration of the Magi. The three kings with their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh can be seen kneeling before the Virgin and her son. The full floral-acanthus border includes a peacock at the base.   Immediately below the miniature is a 3-line initial in red, orange, and blue with white tracery on a gold ground.\n\nThe Book of Hours was a medieval prayer book used by laymen for private devotion. These books were created for both men and women, but their place in female devotion is particularly noteworthy. The text centres on the Hours of the Virgin, a series of prayers to be said at the eight canonical hours of Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "5124", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-02-18 13:20:20", "lastupdate": "1380766086", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1313440457"}, "originalsecret": "e0bb3769bf", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6201", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/6046620213/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
