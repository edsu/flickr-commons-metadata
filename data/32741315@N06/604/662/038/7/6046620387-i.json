The miniature shown here is one of twelve large miniatures in gold frames, arched at the top and with three or four lines of text underneath. This leaf heralds the beginning of Terce for the Hours of the Virgin. It shows the Annunciation to the Shepherds, when the angel appeared to the shepherds to tell them of the birth of Jesus. The full border consists of a floral acanthus design. Immediately below the miniature is a 3-line initial in red and blue with white tracery on a gold ground.\n\nThe Book of Hours was a medieval prayer book used by laymen for private devotion. These books were created for both men and women, but their place in female devotion is particularly noteworthy. The text centres on the Hours of the Virgin, a series of prayers to be said at the eight canonical hours of Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4371", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-02-18 13:22:34", "lastupdate": "1380766090", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1313440460"}, "originalsecret": "8e3bec0b4e", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6089", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/6046620387/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
