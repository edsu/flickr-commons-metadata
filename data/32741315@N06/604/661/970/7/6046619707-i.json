The miniature featured here is one of twelve large miniatures in gold frames, arched at the top and with three or four lines of text underneath. This leaf shows the beginning of the psalm for first vespers in the Office of the Dead. The miniature shows St Michael fighting a devil over two corpses; a third \u2018corpse\u2019 is ascending into heaven. The full border is a floral-acanthus design with twining ivy leaves. Immediately below the miniature is a 3-line initial in red, blue and orange with white tracery on a gold ground. The last line of text is completed with a line filler.\n\nThe Book of Hours was a medieval prayer book used by laymen for private devotion. These books were created for both men and women, but their place in female devotion is particularly noteworthy. The text centres on the Hours of the Virgin, a series of prayers to be said at the eight canonical hours of Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "5377", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-02-18 12:01:43", "lastupdate": "1380766084", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1313440448"}, "originalsecret": "1d7acf7800", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6077", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/6046619707/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
