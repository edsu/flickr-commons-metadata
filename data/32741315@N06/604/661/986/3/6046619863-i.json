The miniature is one of twelve large miniatures in gold frames, arched at the top and with three or four lines of text underneath. This leaf at the beginning of Compline for the Hours of the Virgin depicts the Coronation of the Virgin. The full border is a floral acanthus design; a butterfly can be seen at the top left.  Immediately below the miniature is a 3-line initial in red, blue and orange with white tracery on a gold ground. The last line of text is completed with a line filler.\n\nThe Book of Hours was a medieval prayer book used by laymen for private devotion. These books were created for both men and women, but their place in female devotion is particularly noteworthy. The text centres on the Hours of the Virgin, a series of prayers to be said at the eight canonical hours of Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "5148", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-02-18 13:12:22", "lastupdate": "1362271740", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1313440451"}, "originalsecret": "cd5e27ac9c", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6075", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/6046619863/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
