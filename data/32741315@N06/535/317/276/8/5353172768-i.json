These covers could then be replaced by a permanent binding of the purchaser's choice. Temporary bindings often have untrimmed text edges and may be stab-stitched rather than sewn. Because of their flimsy nature these covers have not survived in large numbers. \n\nA popular 18th century cover  for small publications such as children's books, chapbooks, and pamphlets was Dutch gilt paper. In making this paper, an engraved roller or wooden block was used to impress the pattern on a sheet of paper coated with size, a substance that helps to prevent the absorption of liquids and improves the paper's surface. Before it dried, gold dust was applied and colours were dabbed or stencilled on. Although called Dutch papers, they were probably made in Germany. \n\nUpper cover of Jacques L'Hermite, \u2018Iovrnael vande Nassausche vloot\u2019 (t'Amstelredam: by Hessel Gerritsz ende Iacob Pietersz Wachter, t'laer, 1626).
