His favourite geometrical pattern, the square with a semicircle in the centre of each side, can be seen at the centre of this binding.\n\nThe Geometrical Compartment Binder bound at least four other copies of Gander's work: three with very similar designs, and a fourth held in the King's Library of the British Library in almost identical design. Blind-tooled quartering lines, the finisher's guidelines for the gold-tooled pattern, are just visible on this cover.\n\nPurchased by Alexander Turnbull.\n\nUpper cover of Joseph Gander, \u2018The glory of Her Sacred Majesty Queen Anne\u2019 (London: Printed for the authour, 1703).
