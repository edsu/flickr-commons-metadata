Many hours of work have gone into creating this ornate design and it would have been prepared either for a wealthy client, or for presentation to a person of standing. Goatskin was the most expensive of the four standard animal skins used for bookbindings and was almost always chosen for high-quality work, because of its durability, its hard, shiny and well-grained surface, and because it can be effectively dyed in a range of colours.\n\nThe binder of this volume was possibly John Houlden (d.1670), a Cambridge binder who had strong associations with the University, where this book was printed. Houlden is known to have bound books nearly every year for the University from 1637 until 1662.\n\nThis volume was formerly in the library of Lord Amherst of Hackney. It was sold at the Amherst auction on 3 December 1908, where it was purchased by the London bookseller Bernard Quaritch for \u00a339. It was subsequently acquired by Alexander Turnbull.\n\nUpper cover and spine of \u2018The book of common prayer [bound with] Holy Bible [and] Whole book of psalms\u2019 ([Cambridge]: Printed by Thomas Buck and Roger Daniel, 1638). fREng BIBLE 1638."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4210", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-10-07 12:23:53", "lastupdate": "1373208264", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1294958568"}, "originalsecret": "717de192db", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5084", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/5353172318/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
