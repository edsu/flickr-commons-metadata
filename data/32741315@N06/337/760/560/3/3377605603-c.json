All of the oarsmen have rank stripes at the lower end of their sleeves, as per officers, and may all be Lieutenants, although the detail here is insufficent to be sure.  The involvement of an Admiral (sitting in the stern of the boat) is denoted by the flag in the bow.  Admirals underway in ships or boats would have flags indicating how senior the Admiral is.  In cars, it would be a plate with balls or stars.  Rear Admirals have flags with two balls, Vice Admirals with one ball and full Admirals with none (the coarser way of remembering the ranks during my naval career was that the older the Admiral, the more wizened and less virile, thus reducing numbers of balls).
