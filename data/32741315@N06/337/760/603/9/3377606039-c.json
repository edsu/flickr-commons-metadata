We later boarded the over night express for Auckland. She was a lovely old ship and I attended the 40th anniversary of her reunion in Auckland and shot some video of the function.\nGreat to see another picture of her. I have some good ones in my collection.\n\nRobert Taylor", "authorname": "Southern Cause", "id": "32695993-3377606039-72157627353652384", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/3377606039/#comment72157629516416777", "realname": "Jessica Louise", "path_alias": "libraness2003", "author": "14293683@N03", "iconserver": "8036", "datecreate": "1330936384", "_content": "Hello,\nIm trying to track my fathers travells to Wellington and i believe this is the ship he arrived on from the Port of Southampton.
