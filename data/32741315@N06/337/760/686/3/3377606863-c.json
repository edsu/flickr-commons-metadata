As you know, my father was a FAA pilot on Indefatigable but he never mentioned its visit to NZ (by that stage he had left the boat for home leave) I got some info from Ross Higgins ( of the Wakefield Steam Museum) about Roy Archer, \n(whom my father never mentioned) that said that Indefatigable had visited him in the Sounds (Pelorus Sound to SW of Maud Island) where Roys friend the Admiral of the Fleet then visited him at Tuna Bay. \nThe picture of the carrier in Queen Charlotte Sound may in fact be Pelorus Sound.</i>", "authorname": "Ice Nine", "id": "32695993-3377606863-72157615850436776", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/3377606863/#comment72157615863787628", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nationallibrarynz_commons", "author": "32741315@N06", "iconserver": "3285", "datecreate": "1237939458", "_content": "Thanks so much Ice Nine (and lovely to hear of your family connection to the image).
