These covers could then be replaced by a permanent binding of the purchaser's choice. Temporary bindings often have untrimmed text edges and may be stab-stitched rather than sewn. Because of their flimsy nature these covers have not survived in large numbers. \n\nTemporary covers were sometimes decorated with printed woodcuts to attract the attention of customers. Here the stiffened maroon paper wrappers have a woodcut print with a geographic symbol appropriate to the volume\u2019s contents. The printed paper labels on the spine suggest that large numbers were bound this way, if not the whole edition; it would not be worth printing labels for one set of 35 volumes. The fore and bottom edges of the textblock are untrimmed. \n\nThe publisher, Antonio Zatta, was also a cartographer and one of his well-known early maps of New Zealand (1776) is held in the Cartographic Collection of the Alexander Turnbull Library.\n\nPurchased 1969.\n\nUpper cover and spine of Anton Friedrich B\u00fcsching, Nuova geografia (Venezia: Presso Antonio Zatta, 1773-82).
