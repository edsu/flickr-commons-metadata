This colourful page contains an historiated initial \u2018C\u2019 showing the author, Boethius, with an open book. The grid behind him depicts his imprisoned state at the time of writing. Acanthus leaves make up the border, with a painted-over coat of arms of the original owner in the lower margin flanked on either side by flowers. A later addition is the sketch of the \u2018pelican in her piety\u2019 (a symbol of self-sacrifice) in the middle of the right-hand border. The link to Lombardy is suggested by the portrait heads, the sharp profiles, elongated finger gestures, the initial and partial border shapes and the colour scheme.\n\nBoethius, the author of this work, was born about 480 into an aristocratic Roman family. He rose to a very high political position, but was arrested for the crime of treason. This work was written around 524 when he was in prison awaiting execution."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3157", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-01-11 12:08:46", "lastupdate": "1379748586", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1294700926"}, "originalsecret": "e4736ff9e7", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5248", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/5343921675/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
