It was very probably made in the Carmelite Convent at Baccaret by Friar Iohannes de Malzeville for the personal use of Prior. On the right-hand page ( f.17) is a figure of a kneeling Carmelite friar with his name in a red scroll in the lower border: \u2018F.[. .].P.d\u2019ARGENT\u2019, that is, Frere Pandargent, who was Prior of Baccarat in 1505. On the opposite page, the last line of text, is one of two contemporary inscriptions inserted into the text apparently by the scribe, although in slightly different ink which states that Johannes de Malzevilla wrote this in 1511. The other inscription on f.58v (not shown) again states that Johannes de Malzevilla was the scribe but also adds that he was a member of the Carmelite Convent at Baccaret. \nThe decoration on f.17 marks the beginning of the fifteen psalms of degree. \n\nThe Book of Hours was a medieval prayer book used by laymen for private devotion. These books were created for both men and women, but their place in female devotion is particularly noteworthy. The text of the Book of Hours centres on the Hours of the Virgin, a series of prayers to be said at the eight canonical hours of Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3283", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-01-11 12:09:11", "lastupdate": "1363301753", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1294700951"}, "originalsecret": "5682777629", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5045", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/5343922621/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
