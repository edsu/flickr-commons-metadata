A Missal is a book containing the text for the Mass. This beautifully decorated manuscript contains illuminated initials in varying sizes from 1- to 6-lines. Originally it also had three elaborate, probably historiated, 8-line initials, but two of these have been cut out of the manuscript (one of these pages is shown here on the left). The left-hand page also has an elaborate border with scroll-acanthus, birds, and feathery spray motifs in blue, orange, red, green, white, black and gold. At the fore-edge of the right-hand page you can see a white page-marker."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2297", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-01-11 12:09:47", "lastupdate": "1364524755", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1294700987"}, "originalsecret": "9a1b76d9a6", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5003", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/5344535652/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
