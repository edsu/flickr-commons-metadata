This miniature of the Pentecost marks the beginning of the Hours of the Holy Spirit. One of eight large miniatures, it is painted in graduated tones of red, blue, green and yellow, with contrasting tones of black, white and charcoal grey. Folds in the drapery are shown with gold cross hatching. 1- and 2-line gold initials on alternating red, blue or green grounds appear throughout the manuscript, and two of these can be seen on this page below the large miniature.\n\nThe Book of Hours was a medieval prayer book used by laymen for private devotion. These books were created for both men and women, but their place in female devotion is particularly noteworthy. The text of the Book of Hours centres on the Hours of the Virgin, a series of prayers to be said at the eight canonical hours of Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, Nones, Vespers, and Compline."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2929", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-01-11 12:08:58", "lastupdate": "1379748576", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1294700938"}, "originalsecret": "9c39a44d07", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5210", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/5344533664/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
