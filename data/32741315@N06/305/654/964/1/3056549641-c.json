It is understood that in_ coming into the steamer's basin, the Wakatipu took ground at the tail ol the bank. The engines were reversed, but- this making no impression, she was put full steam ahead. The Wakatipu cleared the bank at.once, and before way could be stopped, or her course changed, she ran into the Laira. Such is the story of some onlookers. At high water the bulwarks of the Laira were more than a foot under water. The Laira's cargo is valued at \u00a315,000, and the hull at \u00a32.600.&quot;\nAn interesting story.", "authorname": "PalmyLisa", "id": "32695993-3056549641-72157634528070062", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "3056549641"}}
