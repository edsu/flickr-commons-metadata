H. Penney. She was chartered by the N.Z. Shipping Co.\n\nEarly in 1882 the barque was purchased by Messrs. Stone Bros., merchants, of Auckland, and for several years later continued in the London and New Zealand trade. She was later employed in the intercolonial service.\n\n\nTHE BARQUE ALCESTIS AT DUNEDIN.\n\nthe Alcestis had a very rough trip on her voyage to the Bluff in 1885. During one severe gale heavy seas broke on board, smashed the deckhouse and fittings and washed nearly everything movable overboard, including a considerable deck cargo. In 1888, twelve years after she was launched she ran from the Lizard to the Solanders in 93 days.\n\nThe passages outwards by the Alcestis were:\u2014\n\nTO AUCKLAND.\nSailed.Arrived.Captain.Days.\n*Nov. 7, '81Mar. 25, '82Payne\u2014\nTO WELLINGTON.\nNov. 7, '81Mar. 6, '82Payne117\nTO DUNEDIN.\nJune 27Oct. 10, '88Norris106\nTO BLUFF.\nJune 10Oct. 1, '85Munn113\nJune 24Oct. 11, '86Munn109\nJune 12Oct. 8, '87Norris118\n*", "authorname": "madbushfarm", "id": "32695993-3056547475-72157627533566572", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/3056547475/#comment72157629298930493", "realname": "", "path_alias": "swordscookie", "author": "39191857@N05", "iconserver": "3461", "datecreate": "1329127856", "_content": "This is a wonderful shot NLNZ, thank you for sharing and to madbushfarm for the information.
