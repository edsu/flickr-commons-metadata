The men on board missed Durham at 12:10, but concluded that he had gone ashore. Durham was a married man. His wife and children reside at Mansford Bay. He was secretary to the Port Chalmers School Committee and agent for the Port Chalmers Building Society. The jury found an open verdict. The deceased was strangled by the bight of a rope over the beam, his feet being a few inches from the deck. Nothing is known to suggest suicide, and he might have tripped off a loose pipe-head into the bight. It is surmised that, walking along the deck, he stepped on the ventilator tube; that this rolled under him, and he fell forward, his head going into the bight of the rope. \nThank you for posting this.", "authorname": "gb_packards", "id": "32695993-3056548367-72157617235520231", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/3056548367/#comment72157617272376865", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nationallibrarynz_commons", "author": "32741315@N06", "iconserver": "3285", "datecreate": "1240791030", "_content": "Thank *you* for adding that fascinating story, gb_packards\n\n-- Courtney", "authorname": "National Library NZ on The Commons", "id": "32695993-3056548367-72157617272376865", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/3056548367/#comment72157629298977053", "realname": "", "path_alias": "swordscookie", "author": "39191857@N05", "iconserver": "3461", "datecreate": "1329128207", "_content": "And he might have been murdered???
