She entered Port Chalmers in November of 1874. It turned out she was a literal death trap. She had been ordered to make certain repairs and then had changed hands. A new Crew was taken on and an attempt made to leave the harbour. She was stopped at the heads. The vessel was condemned as unseaworthy and later taken to Deborah Bay to be broken up.\n\nShe is referred to in White Wings as being 'an ex-slaver'\n<a href=\"http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Bre02Whit-t1-body-d2-d3-d4.html#name-420093-mention\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Bre02Whit-t1-body-d2-d3-d4...</a>\n\nThe Otago Daily Times also gives an account of the Don Juan's attempt to leave the the harbour.
