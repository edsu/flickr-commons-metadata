Possums are not &quot;now native to New Zealand&quot;, they are an introduced species and very much a pest there, being selective eaters which will happily munch their favourite tree to death before moving onto the next. These are brushtail possums and are protected throughout mainland Australia (and partially protected in Tasmania). So, while some in Australia might consider the brushtail possum a pest, I wouldn't take Mary Cummins' word for it and start trapping 'em willy nilly. Get caught with a bag of brushtails like this in Aus, and you'll have the some explaining to do to the Parks and Wildlife Service.", "authorname": "kiwi_michael", "id": "32695993-4835445465-72157635228432112", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4835445465"}}
