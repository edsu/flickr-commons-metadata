They all had warships moored in Apia harbour. The barameter began to fall but no nation wanted to be the first to leave harbour. In the event, in what was known as the Great Hurricane, the only ship to manage to get out was the British ship Calliope... the rest went down with the loss of hundreds of lives - mostly Germans. Had it not been for the Great Hurricane of 1889 it was more than likely an &quot;incident&quot; would have occured between the Great Powers in Apia Harbour - and World War One would have started - nearly 30 years before an equally obscure incident in Sarajavo.", "authorname": "MJField", "id": "32695993-3114155395-72157624534708916", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/3114155395/#comment72157624411275433", "realname": "", "path_alias": "sangriabulls", "author": "42967920@N00", "iconserver": "2840", "datecreate": "1279549186", "_content": "Now, that is something I have never heard, and I read a lot of history.
