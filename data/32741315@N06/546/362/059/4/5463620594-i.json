Rodeos were also occasions on which he could operate sideshows. Even at the age of 70, in 1960, he was still keen to run the occasional stall at country fairs, selling novelties such as dolls on sticks, acrobat clowns, and Lord\u2019s Prayer medallions.\n\nLife on the road had its drawbacks. His wife Beatrice often regretted her husband\u2019s absences on the road. But on one occasion she had accompanied him in a truck down near Mosgiel, taking sideshow novelties to yet another fair, and they met with an accident. An undated newsclipping in one of Cabot\u2019s scrapbooks (Acc. 82-215) reports &quot;A truck with a caravan attached, owned by Mr C H Cabot, collided with a telegraph pole on the main highway south of Mosgiel golf links at 10 a.m. today. The truck...was laden with goods used as prizes in sideshows. Mr Cabot and his wife, who were passengers, were given medical attention at Mosgiel. The driver received cuts and abrasions&quot;.\n\n<a href=\"http://beta.natlib.govt.nz/records/22798125\" rel=\"nofollow\">View this image's record</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3818", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-02-03 11:12:51", "lastupdate": "1386528011", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1298251722"}, "originalsecret": "d696990bc3", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5257", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/5463620594/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
