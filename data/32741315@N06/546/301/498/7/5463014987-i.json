His itinerary notebook for this tour notes that the circus toured from 14 November 1928 to 3 May 1929, starting in Southland, coming up through Queenstown, Central Otago, up through Canterbury to Christchurch, and then over to the West Coast, Nelson and Blenheim. It crossed to Wellington and proceeded through the Wairarapa to Napier and Gisborne, up to the Bay of Plenty and the towns of the Waikato before heading south again through Taranaki, Palmerston North and Feilding.\n\nThe Evening Post, for 4 February 1929, noted &quot;this time-honoured form of entertainment has lost nothing of its attraction. The big tent has been crowded at all the performances. This circus is of the best...particularly strong in acrobatics; the performances of the Lorenzes, Babette, and the Verduns are outstanding. Attached to the circus is a good menagerie, where strange animals from all parts of the globe may be seen.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://beta.natlib.govt.nz/records/23204323\" rel=\"nofollow\">View this image's record</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3028", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-02-03 11:19:16", "lastupdate": "1359921258", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1298251632"}, "originalsecret": "3abbfcdea8", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5019", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/5463014987/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
