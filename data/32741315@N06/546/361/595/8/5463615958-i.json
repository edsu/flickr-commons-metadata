We show the three pieces here digitally joined. Stewart Black Pty Ltd, a firm of Sydney lithographers, printed the poster in around 1910. It shows the heads of three clowns of the Do Re Mi troupe, members of the Jandaschewsky family, a European troupe of musical clowns, of Russian, Greek, French and Spanish origins. They came to Australia in the 1890s, and were performing up until the 1950s. The Do-Re-Mi trio itself varied in personnel and was performing 1910-1915.\n\n<a href=\"http://beta.natlib.govt.nz/records/23217118\" rel=\"nofollow\">View this image's record</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3804", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2008-04-23 13:44:51", "lastupdate": "1379748518", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1298251612"}, "originalsecret": "f5aba95553", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5099", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/5463615958/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
