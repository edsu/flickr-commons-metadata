He brought it out from Australia and it did badly because of the Depression, costing him a lot of money. It had no lions, tigers or elephants although it did have monkeys; basically it was a variety show featuring whipcrackers, sharp shooters and trick cyclists.\n\nIn fact many of these performers had been on earlier trips to New Zealand, and almost the entire company turned up in 1932 (the following year) as Volpa Bros Circus, billed as &quot;entirely new to Wellington&quot;. This casts doubt as to whether the Pedro Bros show lasted long enough to reach Wellington the previous year, even though it performed in Thames.\n\n<a href=\"http://beta.natlib.govt.nz/records/23212499\" rel=\"nofollow\">View this image's record</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4076", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-02-03 11:17:54", "lastupdate": "1379748509", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1298251653"}, "originalsecret": "a073cc3dda", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5297", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/5463617692/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
