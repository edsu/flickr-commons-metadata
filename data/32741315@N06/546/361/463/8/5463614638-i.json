However, by then he had already been captivated by the world of entertainment.\n\nAt the age of 21 he worked for a year or so for the Empire Picture Company (1911-1912), and in 1912 he and his new wife traveled around New Zealand by horse and cart with touring circus groups. Cabot doubled as a horn-player in the McMahon Circus orchestra.\n\nThis 1923 newsclipping shows a full-length profile caricature of Charles Cabot in suit and brimmed felt hat, after he had spent some years in the publicity business, and become quite well-known. It is likely to be from the Sydney variety and show world periodical <em>Everyone\u2019s</em>, 13 June 1923.\n\n<a href=\"http://beta.natlib.govt.nz/records/22898729\" rel=\"nofollow\">View this image's record</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2920", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-01-17 13:21:23", "lastupdate": "1339471866", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1298251585"}, "originalsecret": "f8cf01d38d", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5180", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/5463614638/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
