He was a friend and political follower of Michael Savage. I bet all my dollars that Savage was killed by Fraser's people. The moment Savage died my great grand father was exiled from New Zealand by Fraser. he was a great man as great as Savage himself but you can't find much information on him despite everything he tried to do for the people. Corrupt government much? they jammed his damn radio signals in 35 on the eve of the election!! AND ruined his credibility and cost him his creation  &quot;Associated TV&quot; which he started when he was exiled to Australia. associated tv is now Chanel Ten and stuff here in Australia. My heart goes out to Savage and all those that are his descendants. There were big plans for that country to make it for the people. Savage built his own house with his bare hands!
