Russell's Top was joined to Baby 700 by a thin bridge of land called the Nek. \n\n&quot;The Top&quot; was the highest point within the ANZAC perimeter and commanded views along most of the Turkish line to the south of Baby 700. On it was sited an artillery battery and at least eight machine-guns. It was named after Brigadier Andrew Russell, commander of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, who established his headquarters on it in May 1915.&quot; &mdash; <i><a href=\"http://www.awm.gov.au/units/place_78.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Australian War Memorial</a></i>\n\nRev Ernest Northcroft Merrington (the photographer), (1876-1953) was chaplain to the Australian Light Horse Regiment.
