The landing, which commenced on the night of 6 August 1915, was intended to support a breakout from the Anzac sector, five miles (8 km) to the south.\n\n&quot;Despite facing light opposition, the landing at Suvla was mismanaged from the outset and quickly reached the same stalemate conditions that prevailed on the Anzac and Helles fronts. On 15 August, after a week of indecision and inactivity, the British commander at Suvla, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Stopford was dismissed. His performance in command was one of the most incompetent feats of generalship of the First World War.&quot; &mdash; <i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_at_Suvla_Bay\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a></i>\n\nRev Ernest Northcroft Merrington (the photographer), (1876-1953) was chaplain to the Australian Light Horse Regiment.
