Should have had a third. Used dardanel troy Cannakale as a base and left car at Kilitbahir. Our visit was focussed on the British landings in the Cape Hellas area and Morto Bay as well as Gully Ravine. There was more than enough to see with British, French and Turkish sites. It is a must to read up on the Gallipoli campaign before you go. Pretty spectacular and difficult terrain was dwarfed by a second visiting Suvla and Anzac areas <a href=\"http://www.privatetoursinistanbul.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.privatetoursinistanbul.com</a> Spectacularly beautiful and daunting/terrible for those who fought there. September is a quiet time for a visit with good weather although very dry. Well worth the visit Thank you all so much.", "authorname": "Pirharun", "id": "32695993-3466808406-72157628042438554", "iconfarm": 7}], "photo_id": "3466808406"}}
