The leaf has been removed from its original source and re-used as a bookbinding. The music is written in black square notation on red four-line staves, with movable F and C clefs. \n\nMovable clefs can sit on any one of the four lines depending upon the range of the chant. Thus if most of the notes are going to be above C, then the C clef is placed on the lowest line. This avoids having to use leger lines.\n\nThe manuscript is rubricated (i.e. decorated in red), and the chant beginning with the red letter \u2018G\u2019 is \u2019Gaude fidelis co[n]cio adest\u2019, 1st antiphon at Matins for the feast of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. \n\nCovers and spine of Johann Rudolf Glauber, Operis mineralis (Amsterodami: Prostant apud Joannem Janssonium, 1659).
