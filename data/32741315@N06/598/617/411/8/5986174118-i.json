This page shows a decorated letter \u2018D\u2019 for the beginning of Psalm 39 Dixi custodiam.\n\nPsalters contained the 150 psalms from the Old Testament. They could also include some other standard texts such as a liturgical calendar, a litany, and the canticles (Old Testament songs). The psalter was the most popular type of illuminated book from the eleventh to the fourteenth century. Thereafter the Book of Hours became the most important channel for illuminations. Because psalms played a central role in the performance of the medieval liturgy, psalters were kept at altars and were owned by individual monks and clergy. Psalms were also read extensively for private devotion by both monks and secular clerics. This practice spread to the laity so that, from at least the twelfth century, richly decorated psalters became a form of personal prayer book."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3365", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-05-04 16:15:13", "lastupdate": "1362271709", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1311894990"}, "originalsecret": "dc2d5b5c6c", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6017", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/5986174118/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
