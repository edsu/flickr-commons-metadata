The leaf design is continued on the spine. The edges and turn-ins are also gold tooled. The upper turn-in is stamped: Morrell binder. \n\nThe bookbinding firm Morrell was originally founded by W.T. Morrell in 1861 when he acquired the workshop of Charles Lewis at 17 Frith Street, Soho, London. Morrell\u2019s son W.J. Morrell took over the management in 1887 after his father\u2019s death, and subsequently brought his brother John Morrell into partnership. In 1891 an observer noted that W.J. &amp; J. Morrell, at that time employing 50 people, preferred to bind all their work by hand and the gilding and the marbling of both paper and leathers was also done onsite. A speciality for which they were known were bindings in the Roger Payne style, although this firm was also known for their own creative designs.\n\nPurchased by Alexander H. Turnbull in 1907 from Bernard Quaritch.\n\nUpper cover of Algernon Charles Swinburne, Laus veneris (London: Edward Moxon &amp; Co., 1866 [i.e. ca. 1890]).
