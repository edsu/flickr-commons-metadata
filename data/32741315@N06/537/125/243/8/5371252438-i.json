The spine is gold tooled, and the top text edges are gilt.\n\nEdgar Mansfield (1907-1996) was one of New Zealand\u2019s most renowned expatriate artists, and was widely recognised, particularly in England, as one of the most innovative and influential 20th-century bookbinders. Born in London in 1907, Mansfield was brought up in Napier, New Zealand and after studying art in Napier and Dunedin, moved to London in 1934 to further his studies. His style is characterised by the asymmetrical treatment of rectangular space, the use of expressive, non-figurative designs, and the innovative use of colour, leather, and synthetic materials. This volume was bound in England.\n\nPurchased 1976 from Maggs Bros.\n\nUpper cover of Paul Val\u00e9ry, Eupalinos, ou, L\u2019architecte (Paris : E\u0301ditions de la Nouvelle revue fran\u00e7aise, [1923]).
