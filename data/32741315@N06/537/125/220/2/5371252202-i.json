The spine is tooled in brown, the fore and bottom text edges are untrimmed, and the top text edges are gilt. \n\nEdgar Mansfield (1907-1996) was one of New Zealand\u2019s most renowned expatriate artists, and was widely recognised, particularly in England, as one of the most innovative and influential 20th-century bookbinders. Born in London in 1907, Mansfield was brought up in Napier, New Zealand and after studying art in Napier and Dunedin, moved to London in 1934 to further his studies. His style is characterised by the asymmetrical treatment of rectangular space, the use of expressive, non-figurative designs, and the innovative use of colour, leather, and synthetic materials.
