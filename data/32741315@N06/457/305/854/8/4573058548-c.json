A <a href=\"http://www.archives.presbyterian.org.nz/WaikatoPresbytery.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">note on the NZ Presbyterian Church website</a> says that &quot;The wooden Church, which had been built in 1910, was blown off its piles in 1930. Butresses were then added to the exterior of the building which cost the Parish \u00a368 pounds &amp; ten shillings.&quot;\n\nDoes anyone know if the building still exists, and what its street address is/was? I'd love to add it to our map.\n\n-- Courtney", "authorname": "National Library NZ on The Commons", "id": "32695993-4573058548-72157623862344303", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/4573058548/#comment72157623902586857", "realname": "carlosbezz", "path_alias": "artlandstudio", "author": "22694125@N02", "iconserver": "7427", "datecreate": "1273441362", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1225214@N25/\">artland</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "artland", "id": "32695993-4573058548-72157623902586857", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "4573058548"}}
