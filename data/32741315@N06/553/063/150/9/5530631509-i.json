This page introduces Vespers. The borders are of conventional early sixteenth-century floral acanthus design. The initials are graded in importance, from the opening three-line \u2018D\u2019 in blue with white tracery on a ground of gold leaf to mark the beginning of Vespers; the two-line \u2018D\u2019 for the beginning of Psalm 109 Dixit Dominus Domino meo; to the one line initials for each verse of Psalm 109 alternately in gold leaf with black penwork, and blue initials with red penwork.\n\nThe Book of Hours was a medieval prayer book used by laymen for private devotion. These books were created for both men and women, but their place in female devotion is particularly noteworthy. The text centres on the Hours of the Virgin, a series of prayers to be said at the eight canonical hours of Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3936", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-02-16 08:13:12", "lastupdate": "1379748484", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1300245886"}, "originalsecret": "510d43323a", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5020", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/5530631509/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
