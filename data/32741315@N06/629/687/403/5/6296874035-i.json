Akersten, 1869, Letterpress, 445 x 284 mm, Printed Ephemera Collection, Alexander Turnbull Library, Reference: Eph-C-AUCTION-1869-01\n\nWithout the benefit of colour or the funds to introduce illustration, this poster again shows a very effective use of different typefaces, emphasising the goods for sale at an auction on Saturday 6th March.\n\nWilliam Akersten, whose goods were being put up for sale, was a provincial councillor and remained active in the community despite this setback. In fact this poster may have been used for more than one auction in March, as its specific date has been pencilled into a blank space.\n\nA search of the Nelson evening mail for early 1869 shows that several other auction sales had been held in January and February for Akersten\u2019s house, warehouse and boat \u201cCollingwood\u201d; his plant and gear, and the cutter \u201cUnity\u201d; and two further sales of stock (ship-chandlery, anchors, chains, ironmongery, grocery, oilmen's stores, drapery, wearing apparel, paints, oils, brushware, earthenware, tinware, fancy goods, cutlery, nautical instruments, and stationery, perfumery, patent medicines). More land near the wharf was auctioned on 7 April 1869.\n\n<a href=\"http://beta.natlib.govt.nz/records/23101490\" rel=\"nofollow\">Take a closer look</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3722", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1869-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1360352877", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1320028804"}, "originalsecret": "2eb7ae1907", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6038", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/6296874035/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
