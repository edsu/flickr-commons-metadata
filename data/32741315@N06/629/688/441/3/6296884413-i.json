The driver, George Fernandos was likely from the Greek Fernandos family, Wellington fishmongers, and began work as a chauffeur in Wellington in 1909. The taxi-cab industry had barely begun late in that year.\n\nFrom the Evening Post, 22 November 1909, Page 6:\n\n&quot;Constables, armed with stop-watches, have recently been stationed along the main thoroughfares of Newtown, in order to regulate the traffic and to detect any offences against the bylaws. As a result, the drivers of two motor-cars were to-day convicted in the Magistrate's Court for driving at a dangerous speed. One of the offenders \u2014 George Fernandos \u2014 was the chauffeur of taxicab No. 70, owned by Messrs Reid and Keene. According to the official timekeepers, he drove his car at a speed of twenty-three miles per hour from Constable-street to Riddiford-street, and twenty-seven miles thence to John-street, or an average of twenty-five miles an hour. In entering a plea of not guilty, Mr P. W. Jackson, who appeared for defendant, urged that the car was not geared up to such a high rate of speed. Sub-Inspector Norwood contended that, being on the down-grade, the vehicle had gathered the speed mentioned. Defendant was fined 40s, with costs 9s,- in default, seven days' imprisonment.&quot;\n\nA year later, Mr Fernandos was adjudged bankrupt, owing to some business failures, first in Napier from 1906-1908 and then as a chauffeur in Wellington.\n\n<a href=\"http://beta.natlib.govt.nz/records/22835039\" rel=\"nofollow\">Take a closer look</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "9025", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1909-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1386527955", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1320029003"}, "originalsecret": "7c56b80940", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6019", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/6296884413/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
