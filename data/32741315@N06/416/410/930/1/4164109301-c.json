From the extended notes on the image in our files:\n\n&quot;A stall at a trade fair probably held in Auckland, advertising and displaying a machine for postal service &quot;Neopost, a post office on your own premises&quot;. The sign reads &quot;Neopost, the best British meter mailing machine&quot;, and there is a large poster showing a sample which reads &quot;Neopost, Campbell Buildings, High Street, Auckland&quot; and is dated 9 Jul 1930, 1d postage. Other signs read &quot;A turn of the handle stamps postmarks, and prints a slogan&quot;, and &quot;The machine that stamps, cancels and advertises in one revolution&quot;.&quot;\n\nPersonally, I love the Wendy House aesthetic; I'd love to have one of these little booths instead of my cubicle at work!\n\n-- Courtney", "authorname": "National Library NZ on The Commons", "id": "32695993-4164109301-72157622838383179", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationallibrarynz_commons/4164109301/#comment72157622842509669", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "37244380@N00", "iconserver": "119", "datecreate": "1260370010", "_content": "Courtney - Sorry, silly of me to not look in 'more about this image'.
