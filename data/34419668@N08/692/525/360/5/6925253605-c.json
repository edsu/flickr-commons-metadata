After being transferred to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation it was purchased by American Overseas Airlines on 24 November 1945, and named Flagship Glasgow and later renamed Flagship Berlin. It later went to Pan Am on 25 September 1950, when Pan Am bought American Overseas Airlines. It was first named Clipper Munich, then Clipper Frankfurt and finally Clipper Mermaid.
