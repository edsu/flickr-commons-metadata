This seems to be the same position where boats are still landed. There is still a bridge in the same position, too, but that looks different nowadays. Yes, a very nice picture. You may compare buildings with my recent picture below.\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardy_mvw/5171169837/]\n\nOne reason to believe that this is the same position is the facts that boats were rarely taken higher in the river than below the little waterfall called Islandsfallet. The stretch of river immediately below this diminutive waterfall is considered the most ancient market place in the area. A thousand years ago, people used the river as a means of transportation of  goods to be sold at the winter market. Ice facilitated transportation.
