You see the end of the lake? There's since long time ago a huge dam, serving as a water magazine for hydroplants downstream with a total effect of 4,3 GW, a large number. And now 95% of the water flow is passing through a underground plant. Left is a stream of 6 m3/s, usually it was 160 m3/s. It's a shame, the lake system upstream was broken out of the national park.", "authorname": "Saddex", "id": "34326855-7070624851-72157631670608081", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "7070624851"}}
