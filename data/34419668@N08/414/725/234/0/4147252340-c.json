I have added this to the information on the photo in our database, thanks to you :)\n\nThe passage grave was examined in 1894 by the the scientist Gustaf Retzius. He writes in his report (it's in our archives) that the examinations started on September 19th with the help of &quot;two younger, vigorous and interested workers&quot;. (Should it be the guys on the photo?) He also mentions a photograph of the passage grave that the land owner was allowed to use in exchange of some practical services. \nI guess the photo is taken in 1894 and that someone has mistaken a 9 for a 7 when writing the year of the photo when mounting the photograph in the archives.\n\nInteresting to read these old archaeological reports!\n\n/Anna B.", "authorname": "Swedish National Heritage Board", "id": "34326855-4147252340-72157622801750197", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "4147252340"}}
