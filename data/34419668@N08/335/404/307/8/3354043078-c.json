It would be wonderful if one of the ladies on the photo could be identified as your great great grandmother. If she was born in 1816, she should have been 47 years old when this photo was taken in 1863. I hope you will keep on doing research to find the answer! /Anna B.", "authorname": "Swedish National Heritage Board", "id": "34326855-3354043078-72157634902754902", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "3354043078"}}
