The address is 2 Nederpolder, but that street continues to become Hoogpoort (Rue Haut-Port) to the right.\n\nThe building was restored in 1912, when it got this mediaeval gable. The origins of the building go back to the beginnings of the 13th century. Today it is an office of the City of Ghent.\n\nSee this page (in Dutch): <a href=\"http://www.gent.be/eCache/THE/1/464.cmVjPTQ0MTgx.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.gent.be/eCache/THE/1/464.cmVjPTQ0MTgx.html</a>\n\nAnd the present-day view courtesy of <a href=\"http://maps.google.nl/maps?q=hoogpoort,+gent&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.054277,3.726833&amp;spn=0.000007,0.006947&amp;hnear=Hoogpoort,+9000+Gent,+Oost-Vlaanderen,+Vlaams+Gewest,+Belgi%c3%ab&amp;gl=nl&amp;t=m&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=51.054313,3.726732&amp;panoid=pWn-x7Q0UqkNlqvwshAvew&amp;cbp=12,149.81,,0,-10.5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Streetview</a>.\n\nAnd a picture of 2010:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/erfgoed/318892470/\" title=\"De Kleine Sikkel, Gent by Erf-goed.be, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm1.staticflickr.com/126/318892470_d7d04d880b_m.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" alt=\"De Kleine Sikkel, Gent\" /></a>", "authorname": "Michiel2005", "id": "34326855-7920627954-72157631383609806", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/7920627954/#comment72157631384994282", "realname": "", "path_alias": "swedish_heritage_board", "author": "34419668@N08", "iconserver": "7395", "datecreate": "1346682629", "_content": "Michiel2005: You have been to a great help, giving us all this information about the building in our photo and its location, as well as posting the recent photo by Erf-goed.be\nWith this new information, our photo gets its full value, Thanks to you! :)\n\nI found this information in English: \n<a href=\"http://www4.gent.be/gent/english/monument/kleine%20sikkel/sikkel_klein.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www4.gent.be/gent/english/monument/kleine%20sikkel/sikkel...</a>\n\n/Anna B.", "authorname": "Swedish National Heritage Board", "id": "34326855-7920627954-72157631384994282", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/7920627954/#comment72157631403733118", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "86563512@N07", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1346769546", "_content": "thats a great pic", "authorname": "chiechie3", "id": "34326855-7920627954-72157631403733118", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/7920627954/#comment72157631480651950", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ammeline", "author": "86896846@N03", "iconserver": "8173", "datecreate": "1347198497", "_content": "beautiful.", "authorname": "ammeline", "id": "34326855-7920627954-72157631480651950", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "7920627954"}}
