I got a bit carried away  and asked some expertise in order to identify the ships.  After providing some magnified high definition extracts of the photograph this information came up):\n\nThe picture depicts major parts of the coast fleet. The large ship is HMS Svea (armored ship of the 1st class) built in 1885-86 at the Lindholmen shipyard in G\u00f6teborg, Sweden. There are at least 4 gunboats of the Blenda-class. One of them seen behind Svea might be Disa. (Thanks to Henrik L, Karlstad). /Lars L", "authorname": "Swedish National Heritage Board", "id": "34326855-3341902132-72157615764932875", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/3341902132/#comment72157615886703222", "realname": "", "path_alias": "wrote", "author": "87762368@N00", "iconserver": "1153", "datecreate": "1237989074", "_content": "Great work RAA :)", "authorname": "Wrote", "id": "34326855-3341902132-72157615886703222", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/3341902132/#comment72157622800232056", "realname": "Britt-Marie Sohlstr\u00f6m", "path_alias": "ylvas", "author": "97449017@N00", "iconserver": "47", "datecreate": "1258198578", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/99398263@N00/\">Sweden before 1945</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "YlvaS", "id": "34326855-3341902132-72157622800232056", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "3341902132"}}
