I passed the question on to G\u00f6ran Ekberg, who is a curator at the Swedish National Maritime Museums and he says that it wasn't unusaual that ships froze like that. It could be due to a cold snap that wasn't anticipated but it was also quite common to leave the ships in the water because it wasn't possible to bring them up for the winter. In those cases some of the crew was sent home and  only a small number were left behind caring for the ship during the winter. \n\nIt can also be said that it was not always completely safe to leave the ships trapped in the ice. The shelving might break... \n\nI also got the information from Bengt Jonasson (a jack tar of my acquaintance) that the ships probably are made of oak - and ships made of oak are only brought up when it is necessary to paint their bottom. They crack if they are brought up on land and the cracks don't thicken when in contact with water as they do on ships made of other types of wood such as pine.\n/Sophie J", "authorname": "Swedish National Heritage Board", "id": "34326855-3346427753-72157615881522611", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/3346427753/#comment72157622658390919", "realname": "Britt-Marie Sohlstr\u00f6m", "path_alias": "ylvas", "author": "97449017@N00", "iconserver": "47", "datecreate": "1257957627", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/99398263@N00/\">Sweden before 1945</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "YlvaS", "id": "34326855-3346427753-72157622658390919", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/3346427753/#comment72157623751318741", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "49368256@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1271523277", "_content": "<a href=\"http://herniateddiscsurgery.net/\" rel=\"dofollow\" rel=\"nofollow\">Herniated Disc Surgery</a> pro says:\n\nthanks Ylva for sharing", "authorname": "MIS!", "id": "34326855-3346427753-72157623751318741", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3346427753"}}
