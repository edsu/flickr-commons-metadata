According to Stuttgart's centuries-old market rights, which are still valid today, only produce grown in W\u00fcrttemberg (or produce which might theoretically be grown there) may be sold - which excludes tropical fruits, for example.\n\n&quot;The buildings framing the current marketplace date from the 1950s and are typical of the functional architecture of the day. By varying the structures and colours of their fa\u00e7ades to correspond with the original building plots, an attempt was made to give at least some idea of the width of the former medieval buildings in the rebuilding plans.&quot;&nbsp;<i>--<a href=\"http://www.stuttgart-tourist.de/ENG/leisure/marktplatz.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stuttgart-tourist</a></i>\n\n&quot;The Market Place (2006)&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by <i>Jen10 </i>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/54022952@N00/325979660/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/141/325979660_3adbad3b80_m.jpg\" alt=\"Xmas Market - Stuttgart\" alt=\"Xmas Market - Stuttgart by 54022952@N00\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n&quot;The Old Market Place (1881)&quot; by<i> Carl Curman</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/3347095050/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/3339/3347095050_b5487ca5bf_m.jpg\" alt=\"The old Market Place, Stuttgart, Germany\" alt=\"The old Market Place, Stuttgart, Germany by swedish_heritage_board\" /></a>", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "34326855-3347095050-72157616101046955", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/3347095050/#comment72157622569598253", "realname": "Patrick Ciebilski", "path_alias": "mccieb", "author": "41747162@N00", "iconserver": "7443", "datecreate": "1256896164", "_content": "All of it was bombed away in WWII - over 90% of the inner city was destroyed.", "authorname": "Patrick Ciebilski", "id": "34326855-3347095050-72157622569598253", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/3347095050/#comment72157624921719930", "realname": "", "path_alias": "kweinland", "author": "20800917@N08", "iconserver": "8535", "datecreate": "1284097704", "_content": "Tolles Bild.
