The area still looks very similar today. At the time the picture was taken the castle was the seat of Otto von Stolberg-Wernigerode, a childhood friend of Bismarck and then the Vice Chancellor of the German Reich. Otto commissioned a huge refashioning of the castle into the mock-medieval dream castle that you see. This remodeling was completed in 1885, so the picture may have been taken shortly thereafter (<a href=\"http://www.schloss-wernigerode.de/htm/de/html/SchlossGeschichte.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.schloss-wernigerode.de/htm/de/html/SchlossGeschichte....</a>).", "authorname": "xiphophilos", "id": "34326855-3347196198-72157629362435453", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/3347196198/#comment72157629414925137", "realname": "", "path_alias": "swedish_heritage_board", "author": "34419668@N08", "iconserver": "7395", "datecreate": "1329817945", "_content": "xiphophilos: Great to have this additional information on the castle, helping us to get closer to the exact date of photography, of this image as well as others from Wernigerode by Curman.
