The Paushuize was built from 1517 by Adriaan Floriszoon Boeyens, who later became pope Adrian VI. \n\nAfter the Reformation the Paushuize and the additions were in private hands, but from 1814 to 1954 the house was the residence of the governor of province of Utrecht and also the provincial parliament met here. \n\nNow the Paushuize is a representative building of the province, used for official occasions, receptions and such like. The university uses the additional buildings since 1996, so in 1934 when this picture was taken, it was the headquarters of the provincial government, hence the expensive car on the bridge.\n\nI don't know whether this part of the Paushuize has a specific name, the University simply calls it after the address of the building: Kromme Nieuwegracht 47e. \n\nSource of all this knowledge is a Dutch wikipedia page: <a href=\"http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paushuize\" rel=\"nofollow\">nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paushuize</a>", "authorname": "Michiel2005", "id": "34326855-7702827412-72157630881341766", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/7702827412/#comment72157630882163668", "realname": "", "path_alias": "swedish_heritage_board", "author": "34419668@N08", "iconserver": "7395", "datecreate": "1343992936", "_content": "Michiel2005: Very interesting to learn more about the building and the Paushuize! \n\nI found a nice little film on the homepage of Het Utrechts Archief (The Utrecht Archives), showing the Paushuize, just around the corner of the additional building on the photo above: <a href=\"http://www.hetutrechtsarchief.nl/thema/toen-en-nu/utrecht/kromme-nieuwegracht\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.hetutrechtsarchief.nl/thema/toen-en-nu/utrecht/kromme...</a>\n\n/Anna B.", "authorname": "Swedish National Heritage Board", "id": "34326855-7702827412-72157630882163668", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/7702827412/#comment72157630883326374", "realname": "", "path_alias": "govert1970", "author": "39839593@N00", "iconserver": "29", "datecreate": "1343999846", "_content": "I looked a bit further, and I don't think this is the 1633 extension to the Paushuize, but a 1828-1833 extension.
