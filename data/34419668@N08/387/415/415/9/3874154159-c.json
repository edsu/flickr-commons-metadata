Nowadays it is situated in Sundsvall Gustaf Adolf parish. But I think I know the explanation.\n\nWe live in H\u00e4rsta, a homestead north of Sundsvall, not far from Sk\u00f6ns church in Sk\u00f6ns parish. This area was once also the municipality of Sk\u00f6n. In the south of present Sundsvall there is an area with streets named after homesteads (stamfastigheter) from around Sk\u00f6ns parish: H\u00e4rsta, R\u00f6msta, F\u00e4rsta, Hillsta, Huggsta. The area is called Sk\u00f6nsmon.\nApparently the farmers of Sk\u00f6ns parish north of town had summer pastures for their cattle south of Sundsvallsviken (Bay of Sundsvall). The cattle was transported by boat across the bay in spring and in autumn.\n\nThat is why Sk\u00f6nsmon once was part of the northern parish of Sk\u00f6n. Kumo is an address in Sk\u00f6nsmon. \n\nAround where we live there are a lot of Iron Age graves, btw. I think we almost have one on our grounds. But there doesn't seem to be any pics from them posted here.", "authorname": "northofsweden", "id": "34326855-3874154159-72157622918329113", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/3874154159/#comment72157622919492357", "realname": "", "path_alias": "swedish_heritage_board", "author": "34419668@N08", "iconserver": "7395", "datecreate": "1261414266", "_content": "northofsweden: Interesting and confusing... The grave is situated in Kumo, which is part of Sk\u00f6n parish according to the text on the photo and data in our archives. I found Kumo on Eniro maps, south of Sundsvall. (Should be southeast of Sundsvall town and not southwest of it, so I'll change that.)\n\nRead about the grave in in this article in Fornv\u00e4nnen from 1924 by the archaeologist Gustaf Hallstr\u00f6m (in Swedish): <a href=\"http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1920talet/1924_259.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">fornvannen.se/pdf/1920talet/1924_259.pdf</a>  There is a map with the graves marked, southeast of the town. \n\nKumo is - as you say - obviously located in Sk\u00f6nsmon and must therefore be part of Sundsvall today. Sk\u00f6nsmon was incorporated in Sundsvall town in 1948. Earlier it was part of Sk\u00f6n parish. I'll change the information.
