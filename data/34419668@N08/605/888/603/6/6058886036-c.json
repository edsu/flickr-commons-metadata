The Swedish article on Wikipedia about &quot;H Day&quot; tells that most Swedish cars were produced with the steering wheel on the left side even before 1967 (as they still are today). One reason was was that the Swedish authorities had indicated at an early stage that a diversion to right-hand traffic would come in the future. Another reason was that the cars mostly where exported to countries with right-hand traffic, where left-hand driven cars where stipulated. \nI'm indeed no expert on cars, but now I've learned more, thanks to you! :)\n\n/Anna B.", "authorname": "Swedish National Heritage Board", "id": "34326855-6058886036-72157630712983490", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/6058886036/#comment72157630724724032", "realname": "", "path_alias": "swordscookie", "author": "39191857@N05", "iconserver": "3461", "datecreate": "1343115168", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board] Anna, I'm shocked!  A European country with forward thinking and planning???? It was wise of them to do so and of course dependable Swedish cars were always a big attraction in those days of very unreliable cars from many other countries.  As a boy growing up in the 40's and 50's car &quot;spotting&quot; was something we did and admired the new models on the market.  Spotting a Volvo or a Saab was a big deal as they were scarce but many of the models we saw then are still going today, a tribute to the work of your countrymen and women.", "authorname": "swordscookie", "id": "34326855-6058886036-72157630724724032", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6058886036"}}
