(Love that about the tram tracks - myself I started studying English horse carriages and found out about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansom_cab\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Hansom cab</a>, but that didn't help a lot in dating the image.) I think these different dates show how difficult it may be to date old images precisely. The dates suggested in your examples stretch from 1870 to 1903 for quite similar images. As you say, I think the photo from the Library of Congress is very close to ours (though tinted), and I will finally date our image c. 1890. \n\nThanks again for your commitment in our Cambridge photo! It's also interesting to know that this was a very popular Cambridge motif for images in the late 1800s.\n\nI'm sorry for not having answered that yet, but yes, I know about Historypin and I really appreciate the site, but right now, we have no plans to expand our photo sharing to other sites than The Commons.
