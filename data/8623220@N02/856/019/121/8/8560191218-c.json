The best known stone and a local landmark is the Buckstone. When Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton visited Monmouth and district, it was painted white in their honour. Up to the middle of the 19th century it used to rock on its base - however in June 1885 a party of five travelling actors from the London Star Company and the landlord at the Agincourt Inn in Monmouth, having enjoyed an evening of sampling fine wines, managed to dislodge the stone and send it crashing down the slope. It split into several pieces, but was hauled back up the hill at great cost and to prevent further vandalisation was cemented together in place and no longer rocks.&quot;\n(from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staunton,_Gloucestershire\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staunton,_Gloucestershire</a>)\n\nsee also <a href=\"http://www.forest-of-dean.net/ebooks/gutenberg/24505/24505-h.htm#page3\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.forest-of-dean.net/ebooks/gutenberg/24505/24505-h.htm...</a>", "authorname": "B-59", "id": "8602872-8560191218-72157633013862995", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8560191218/#comment72157633052530641", "realname": "", "path_alias": "gregoreverb", "author": "10064494@N07", "iconserver": "2816", "datecreate": "1363904306", "_content": "All your scans are over-sharpened.", "authorname": "gregoreverb", "id": "8602872-8560191218-72157633052530641", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "8560191218"}}
