Prussia never had a major navy, nor did the other German states before the German Empire was formed in 1871. Tirpitz took the modest imperial navy and starting in the 1890s turned it into a world-class force that could threaten the British Royal Navy. His navy however was not strong enough to confront the British successfully in World War I; the one great naval Battle of Jutland was a draw. Tirpitz turned to submarine warfare, which antagonized the United States. He was dismissed in 1916 and never regained power.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_von_Tirpitz\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_von_Tirpitz</a>", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-6522025213-72157628447868291", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6522025213/#comment72157628448005199", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "29079609@N02", "iconserver": "5491", "datecreate": "1324076523", "_content": "With his great forked beard, and instantly recognizable man in his time.
