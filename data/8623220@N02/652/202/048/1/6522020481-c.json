The navy based their Far East Squadron there, allowing the ships to conduct operations throughout the Pacific. Beginning January 1898 the marines of III. Seebatallion were based at Tsingtao.\nBefore the outbreak of World War I the ships of the German naval forces under Admiral Count von Spee were located at central Pacific colonies on routine missions. The fleet then rendezvoused in the Marianas to plan a transit to Germany rather than be trapped in the Pacific by Allied fleets.\nAfter a minor British naval attack on the German colony in 1914, Japan occupied the city and the surrounding province during the Siege of Tsingtao after Japan's declaration of war on Germany in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. The failure of the Allied powers to restore Chinese rule to Shandong after the war triggered the May Fourth Movement.", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-6522020481-72157628448136565", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6522020481/#comment72157628451509977", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1324104943", "_content": "Also, see notes under:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6442016071/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7170/6442016071_ee18f8c374_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"175\" alt=\"Kiaotschau (LOC)\" /></a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6522020481-72157628451509977", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6522020481"}}
