Murphy was as corrupt as any other Tammany Hall bosses. The New York Tribune cover (using photo manipulation) tells readers that while McClellan was just elected the mayor of NYC, the REAL power behind the mayor, and the person that will actually make things happen in nyc is the man seated behind McClellan; Charles Murphy, the Tammany Hall boss.\n\n\nhere's a better photo illustrating the relationship of McClellan (the kid on the wall), Murphy (tiger), and district attorney Jerome (guy with shotgun)\n<a href=\"http://www.harpweek.com/09Cartoon/BrowseByDateCartoon.asp?Month=October&amp;Date=14\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.harpweek.com/09Cartoon/BrowseByDateCartoon.asp?Month=...</a>\n\n<img src=\"http://www.harpweek.com/Images/SourceImages/CartoonOfTheDay/October/101405m.jpg\" />\n\n<i>&quot; This cartoon about the 1905 mayoral election in New York City shows the Tammany Tiger licking his chops with satisfaction, having devoured a belly full of political enemies, including Republican boss  Thomas Platt and the Reverend Charles Parkhurst, the crusading reformer.  Mayor George B. McClellan Jr., a candidate for reelection, holds the tiger's leash but cannot control the behavior of the Tammany beast.  The young, 39-year-old mayor appears as a boy sitting, like Humpty Dumpty, atop a wall; in this case, one that protects the &quot;Gardens of Murfiz&quot; (named for Tammany boss Charles F. Murphy), where illicit money grows on trees.  \n\nThe one who has escaped the tiger's path of destruction is William Travers Jerome, the New York district attorney (1901-1909) who continually waged war against the corruption of Tammany Hall and the city government.  Here, Jerome stands priming his firearm to shoot the unsuspecting tiger.  McClellan won a second term a few weeks after this cartoon was published, and soon broke completely with Tammany Hall.  Despite the efforts of Jerome and McClellan, Murphy and Tammany Hall survived.\n\n...&quot;\n</i>\n[read more about the meaning of the illustration, of McClellan, Murphy, Tammany Hall, etc. here\n<a href=\"http://www.harpweek.com/09Cartoon/BrowseByDateCartoon.asp?Month=October&amp;Date=14\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.harpweek.com/09Cartoon/BrowseByDateCartoon.asp?Month=...</a>]", "authorname": "lucky_dog", "id": "8602872-4158734770-72157622938320552", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4158734770/#comment72157622820582327", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jupana", "author": "38789304@N06", "iconserver": "4058", "datecreate": "1260084260", "_content": "Great photography historical.
