Cheap Chinese labor built the western end of the Union Pacific Railroad, but California's native workingmen resented Asians' competition for jobs. As a result of agitation by California politicos, President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880 appointed James B. Angell, president of the University of Michigan here in Ann Arbor, as Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to China, to negotiate a treaty which curtailed, but did not entirely prohibit, what had been viewed as a &quot;flood&quot; of cheap Chinese labor. Angell managed the delicate task, but after he returned to the U. S. in 1881, Congress negated his efforts by passing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which slammed the door shut. \n\nWhile Angell and his wife were in China, they were charmed by the educated Chinese that they met, and invited them to enroll their children at the University of Michigan. A University regent, Levi L. Barbour, established a scholarship program here for Chinese women.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4909925255-72157624806457730", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4909925255"}}
