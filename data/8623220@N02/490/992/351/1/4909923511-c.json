He still holds the major league record of 512 career sacrifice hits, over 100 more than any other player. He was the first major leaguer in modern history to steal 80 bases in a season, and still shares the major league record of six steals in a game, which he accomplished twice in September 1912. He regularly batted over .320, retiring with a career average of .333. He also holds major league records for career games (2,650), assists (7,630) and total chances (14,591) at second base, and ranks second in putouts (6,526). Under the win shares statistical rating system created by baseball historian and analyst Bill James, Collins was the greatest second baseman of all time.", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-4909923511-72157624769524352", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4909923511/#comment72157624781074926", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "91829349@N00", "iconserver": "5466", "datecreate": "1282489023", "_content": "Hmm.
