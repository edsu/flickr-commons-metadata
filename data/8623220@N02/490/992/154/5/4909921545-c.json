When projected movies came in, the establishment added Crystal Hall, a cinema that was reached via a glass staircase that contained a simulated waterfall and colored lights. Charlie Chaplin films played nearly continuously there from 1914 to 1923, when a fire gutted the interior; no one was hurt, but the complex was converted to retail, becoming Orbach's; apparently some of the original building is still incorporated into the present structure. &quot;  (www.nysonglines.com)", "authorname": "rjones0856", "id": "8602872-4909921545-72157624656093875", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "4909921545"}}
