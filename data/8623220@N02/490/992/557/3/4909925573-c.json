He was appointed potential regent for his niece, when his brother (George VI) came to the throne in 1936, and was required to stay in the United Kingdom until she came of age in case her father died and she ascended the throne under age.\nThe Duke served as the 11th Governor-General of Australia, from 1945 to 1947.
