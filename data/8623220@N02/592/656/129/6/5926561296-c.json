You are right, this is indeed the West Side Tennis Club at Forest Hills, Long Island. The event taking place is the Davis Cup Match between the American and the Australasian teams. This photograph shows the doubles match between Anthony F. Wilding and Norman E. Brookes of Australia and the American pair of Maurice E. McLoughlin and Thomas A. Bundy. The Australians would go on to win this match in straight sets, and eventually take the Davis Cup.  The Davis Cup itself is pictured at left on a table, and the scoreboard reveals it is early yet: tied at one game apiece in the first set.  More about this match can be found in <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A07E7D9143AE633A25756C1A96E9C946596D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> from the New York Times of August 15, 1914. \n\nWe will expand the description for this photograph when we update.", "authorname": "Kristi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-5926561296-72157627203484632", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5926561296/#comment72157627079751745", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "14651149@N00", "iconserver": "72", "datecreate": "1310779317", "_content": "I totally missed the scoreboard, and didn't think of the Davis Cup.
