Obviously the sentry was caught up in the hysteria of August 1914 and was acting on the orders that had been given shortly before this: \n\nThe orders for the 9,000 militiamen on guard duty were the same from coast to coast:\u2013 Militiamen employed in the protection of public works, buildings, etc. will not hesitate to take effective measures to prevent the perpetration of malicious injury; and should sentries, piquets, or patrols be obliged to use their weapons and open fire, their aim will be directed at and not (to the danger of peaceable citizens) over the heads of offending parties.", "authorname": "jamica1", "id": "8602872-5926564422-72157627099586693", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "5926564422"}}
