Back in the early 1900s he played third base for Detroit, and he used to steal home. Somebody wrote a poem about him, and the title was \u201cNever Die on Third Moriarty.\u201d All through the rest of his life George felt he knew something about stealing home. When he was umpiring on third base, and on occasion when I\u2019d get on third, he coached me on how to take a lead so I could steal home. I never had the guts enough to try, because I didn\u2019t think I could make it. I\u2019d run down the line, and he\u2019d keep insisting that I take a bigger lead. I was always afraid that I was going to get picked off. But it was interesting to see Moriarty, who was umpiring at third base, coaching me on how to steal home for the Tigers. It became a joke among the players, but I never got up the nerve to try it.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.baseballlibrary.com/excerpts/excerpt.php?book=hank_greenberg&amp;page=6\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.baseballlibrary.com/excerpts/excerpt.php?book=hank_gr...</a>", "authorname": "matt-pearson", "id": "8602872-5964390156-72157627300525676", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "5964390156"}}
