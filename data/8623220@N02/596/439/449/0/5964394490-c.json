Gault attended McGill University. Commissioned in the 2nd Canadian Mounted Rifles, he served in the Second Boer War and joined the Canadian Militia on return to Canada.\nOn the eve of the First World War he offered the Canadian government $100 000 to help raise and equip an infantry battalion for overseas duty, leading to the formation in 1914 of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. Gault accompanied the regiment overseas as second-in-command, fighting until the loss of his left leg. On retirement in 1920, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Taunton at the 1924 general election, and held the seat through two further elections until he retired from the House of Commons at the 1935 general election. Recalled to active duty in the Second World War, he served on staff with the Canadian Army in England (colonel, 1940; brigadier, 1942) and returned to Canada in 1945. Appointed honorary colonel (1948) and colonel (1958) of his regiment, he showed a keen interest in it until his death in 1958.", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-5964394490-72157627260564812", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5964394490/#comment72157627139582477", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1311455156", "_content": "In 1966, I visited a Gault House that belonged to McGill University, a beautiful house on a lake on Mont Saint Hilaire, an estate that had been given to the university as a nature reserve.  Reading the bio that trialsanderrors provided, I couldn't resist seeing if the association might be with this Gault, and it is.\n\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.mcgill.ca/gault/sainthilaire/human/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.mcgill.ca/gault/sainthilaire/human/</a>\n&quot;In 1913, the Campbell family sold 890 hectares of its mountain property to a wealthy young man, Andrew Hamilton Gault. By 1920, the 522 inhabitants of the town of Mont-Saint-Hilaire had electricity, a luxury not enjoyed by the 802 rural members of the parish. The population of the vicinity grew steadily, with about 5,000 people drawing water from Lac Hertel in 1941 when an aqueduct from the lake was constructed.\n\nGault enjoyed many wonderful days on his mountain property as development continued in the region through the early part of the 20th century. He loved the wild nature of the mountain and became committed to preserving its special character. Others were not so respectful. Prospectors searched for uranium and diamonds, posing a threat of expropriation, and others exploited mineral deposits on the flanks of the mountain. Gault remained vigilant and firm in his commitments to protect the mountain during this period, agreeing only to provide water from Lac Hertel to the city of Beloeil beginning in 1940.\n\nIn 1957, Gault began construction of a manor house on the shore of Lac Hertel to which he planned to retire, but he died before its completion. He had left his property to McGill University in the hope that this well-established institution of higher learning could continue his efforts to protect the mountain for future generations. &quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://www.mcgill.ca/gault/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.mcgill.ca/gault/</a>   describes how the estate is used now as a resource for research and public access.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-5964394490-72157627139582477", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5964394490/#comment72157627285783092", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anne_loc", "author": "35014516@N03", "iconserver": "3087", "datecreate": "1311691768", "_content": "trialsanderrors and swanq:  Thanks for the additional information on Gault.
