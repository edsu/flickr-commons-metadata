James W. was not a founder of the conservation movement, except indirectly. He was the father of Amos, Antoinette, and Amos Pinchot. Gifford was encouraged by his father to study forestry, so Gifford, who went on to found the Forest Service in 1905, credited his father with being the &quot;Father of Forestry.&quot; But James was a wealthy New York businessman, not a lumber baron. The Pinchot family funded the establishment of the Yale School of Forestry in 1900, and James probably contributed the bulk of the initial $150,000 and possibly the eventual $300,000. Gifford and others were the founders of the Conservation Movement during TR's presidency. In 1912, Amos and Gifford were major supporters of TR's third-party run for the presidency.", "authorname": "mikemcgeary", "id": "8602872-2515737945-72157612915463518", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2515737945/#comment72157612905219641", "realname": "Pamla J.
