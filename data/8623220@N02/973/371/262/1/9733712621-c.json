Speaks</b> (1859-1945) Commander, Second Brigade, Ohio National Guard, and <b>Major Robert D. Palmer</b>, Adjutant-General, Ohio National Guard.\n\nThe Youngstown Iron Sheet and Tube Company, based in Youngstown, Ohio, was one of the largest steel manufacturers in the world. On January 7, 1916, Sheet and Tube workers at the East Youngstown plant rioted during a strike over working conditions, which resulted in most of the town's business district being burned to the ground. \n\nThe strike was <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9838219796/\">quickly quelled</a> by the arrival of 2,100 National Guard troops, under the command of Brigadier-General Speaks, but not before three people had died and 125 were injured. The arrival of the National Guard as well as offers of increased wages by the steel companies convinced most of the striking workers to return to their jobs. Within a week of the riots the mills were once again operating near full capacity.\n\nThis photograph appears to have been taken taken at the Hazelton Railroad Yards on January 13, 1916, as the Fifth Regiment was leaving East Youngstown (later renamed Campbell, Ohio) by train. <i>&mdash;Compiled:</i> [<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=8c6gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=general+john+c.+speaks+(ohio+national+guard),+major+palmer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xFMq5-Ps5p&amp;sig=HFqev4OpUgyjWdvB6dyOye6xtj4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xFMzUoajAdeo4APTkIDQDw&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=general john c. speaks (ohio national guard), major palmer&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>] [<a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ziVKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nIUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1129,3074008&amp;dq=general+speaks+ohio&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>] [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown_Sheet_and_Tube\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a>] [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_Steel\" rel=\"nofollow\">4</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.ohiomemory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p267401coll36/id/6005/rec/1269\" rel=\"nofollow\">5</a>]\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-9733712621-72157635499649397", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9733712621/#comment72157635529379582", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66311327@N05", "iconserver": "7333", "datecreate": "1379225432", "_content": "Other persons related to the strike:\nOscar R.
