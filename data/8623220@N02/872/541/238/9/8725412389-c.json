Situated on a nine acre site overlooking the sea, the Home was designed by the architect Frederick Wheeler.\n\nThe Home was designed as a place where working men could convalesce after an illness or accident and enable them to become fully active again. Opened in March, 1897, it was taken over by the Carpenter's Company in 1911 and was extensively modernized in the 1970's.\n\nNow, over 100 years later, Rustington welcomes both men and women of all ages and from every walk of life.\n\n&nbsp;\n<b>Rustington Convalescent Home &ndash; Then and Now</b> (100+ years later)\n&nbsp;\n&quot;Rustington Conv.
