(If the view were to the south, the scenery would be more steeply hilly and more wooded.  In fact, just downstream from the viewpoint and behind the camera, the Thames passes through the 'Goring Gap' - where the Chalk downs drop directly to the river banks on the outer curves of its river bends.", "authorname": "Darkroom Daze", "id": "8602872-8725424433-72157633495989870", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8725424433/#comment72157633509266696", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anne_loc", "author": "35014516@N03", "iconserver": "3087", "datecreate": "1368706838", "_content": "Thanks for the additional info, Darkroom Daze!", "authorname": "Anne (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-8725424433-72157633509266696", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "8725424433"}}
