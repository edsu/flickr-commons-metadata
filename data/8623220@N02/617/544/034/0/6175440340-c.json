He also threw a spitball, but &quot;about the best you could say for it was that it was wet,&quot; recalled his catcher Hank Gowdy.</i>", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "8602872-6175440340-72157627736190728", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6175440340/#comment72157627737284708", "realname": "", "path_alias": "tinos", "author": "18756995@N00", "iconserver": "2698", "datecreate": "1316817237", "_content": "Very coo pic", "authorname": "\u23a8 zzz \u23ac", "id": "8602872-6175440340-72157627737284708", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6175440340/#comment72157627656619729", "realname": "Mohammed Al-Dhafeeri", "path_alias": "q8ieng", "author": "44545397@N03", "iconserver": "5484", "datecreate": "1317310867", "_content": "Marvelous work!", "authorname": "M.
