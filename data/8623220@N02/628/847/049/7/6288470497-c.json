They had a vital role at a time when telecommunications were limited and insecure. In the British Army, motorcycle despatch riders were first used in the World War I by the Royal Engineers Signal Service. The riders were originally volunteers, some of whom supplied their own machines.&quot;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-6288470497-72157627997428966", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6288470497/#comment72157628054667996", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1320453239", "_content": "LOC -- Bain's caption has no comma.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-6288470497-72157628054667996", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6288470497"}}
