The site of the cathedral has been a place of worship since the 7th century. The three spires of the cathedral are one of Cork's main landmarks. It is the seat of the Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, currently Bishop Paul Colton. It is named after Cork's patron saint.\n\nA Medieval Cathedral was situated on the site prior to the 18th Century building, but few traces of it are visible. The cathedral was damaged during the siege of Cork in 1689/90, when it came under fire from the nearby Elizabeth Fort. When the steeple was demolished in 1865, a 24-pound cannon was discovered, which is now on display in the cathedral.\n\nA small Neo-Classical building was constructed on the site in 1735 by Bishop Peter Browne. It was demolished in 1865 to make way for the present cathedral. The 1735 entrance gate survived the re-building and is still in use.\n\nArchitect William Burges began work on the present Gothic Revival cathedral in 1862. Construction started on the cathedral in 1865 and in 1870 the unfinished building was consecrated. The towers and spires were finally completed in 1879.\n\nBurges gifted a Resurrection Angel, made of copper and gold leaf, which is located on the pinnacle of the sanctuary roof. There is a local superstition which states that if ever the angel falls, it would signify the end of the world.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mickdunne101/4746188267/\">www.flickr.com/photos/mickdunne101/4746188267/</a>", "authorname": "mick dunne", "id": "8602872-4426672281-72157625859730450", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4426672281/#comment72157626973587007", "realname": "", "path_alias": "russianchild007", "author": "39959787@N06", "iconserver": "5338", "datecreate": "1309615331", "_content": "<b>Gesehen</b> in: <img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/2373102807_bb01b2908d.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"155\" alt=\"\" /> \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1439200@N23/\"> <b>Kirchen, Kl\u00f6ster und Kapellen (K-K-K)\nJust great!</b></a>", "authorname": "Josef Lex", "id": "8602872-4426672281-72157626973587007", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "4426672281"}}
