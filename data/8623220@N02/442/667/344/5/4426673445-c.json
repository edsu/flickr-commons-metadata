Certainly its shape does resemble a very thick moustache. A unique footbridge made with drywall construction, it has an extremely high arch. In fact, it seems amazing that anyone could actually mount it. The bridge dates from the 17th century and was built by English occupation settlers. Do not attempt to cross it today. A much safer footbridge is further down the road on your left.\n\nThere is one bridge by this name in Lancashire in England", "authorname": "mikescottnz", "id": "8602872-4426673445-72157623488793981", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4426673445/#comment72157623613381186", "realname": "MARY LAVELLE", "path_alias": "marylavelle", "author": "32569896@N02", "iconserver": "5461", "datecreate": "1268514114", "_content": "Thank you for sharing this informationm I shall try and find  this treasure when next I'm in West Cork.", "authorname": "Mary Evans Lavelle", "id": "8602872-4426673445-72157623613381186", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "4426673445"}}
