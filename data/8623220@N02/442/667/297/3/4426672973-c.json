These included Annie Moore and her two brothers \u2013 the first immigrants to be processed on Ellis Island in New York. On 11 April 1912 Queenstown was the final port of call for the RMS Titanic as she set out across the Atlantic on her ill-fated maiden voyage. The RMS Lusitania was sunk by a German U-Boat off the Old Head of Kinsale on May 7, 1915. The survivors were brought to the town of Cobh, and over one hundred victims lie buried in the Old Church Cemetery about a mile north of the town. \n\nThe chilling last words of 19-year-old Jeremiah Burke from Glanmire, Co. Cork, were slipped into a bottle not read until a year after his death on the Titanic. Now, the emotional artifact is on display at Cobh Heritage Centre. Using the bottle of holy water that his mother gave to him when she saw him off in Cobh, Burke used one of his very own shoelaces to tie it up and threw the letter overboard. The letter simply reads: &quot;From Titanic, goodbye all, Burke of Glanmire, Cork.\u201d", "authorname": "Adrian O Sullivan !!", "id": "8602872-4426672973-72157629995821448", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4426672973/#comment72157635452465214", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1378726364", "_content": "Closer view in B&amp;W at a very similar date over at the nli:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8272163714/\" title=\"Queenstown, where soldiers found a home, and sailors their rest by National Library of Ireland on The Commons, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8484/8272163714_07a41092e5_t.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"76\" alt=\"Queenstown, where soldiers found a home, and sailors their rest\" /></a>", "authorname": "Niall McAuley", "id": "8602872-4426672973-72157635452465214", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "4426672973"}}
