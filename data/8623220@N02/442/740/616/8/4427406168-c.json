The Royal Irish Academy, a cross-border institution, and the oldest research body in Ireland decided after much discussion to call the city, Derry and the county, Londonderry.  Politicians and locals all split in different ways.  Originally designated Doire na Calgach in the 6-7th centuries the city over time became Doire and further Anglicized to Derry.  Doire being Irish for oakwood.  With the plantation of the area by merchants from London in the 16th and 17th Centuries the name became Londonderry and so the battles began as to what to call the place.  The local radio station in an effort to reduce tensions calls this provincial town, Stroke City.", "authorname": "doctorbob", "id": "8602872-4427406168-72157623488672211", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427406168/#comment72157623651153872", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1269013184", "_content": "Thank you doctorbob, for the additional information.
