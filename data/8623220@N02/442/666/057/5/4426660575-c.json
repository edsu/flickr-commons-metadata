As a past student of geography I have sat and listened to distinguished professors argue as to whether it really is a Fjord.  The general consensus is that it would be one if it were in the Nordics but as it is not then it is Fjord-like.  Don't you love the pedanticism of academia?  I remember in 1992 sitting on the edge of the site having a Mars bar and watching the beautiful vista when much to my surprise a submarine emerged from the Harbour.  It's well known amongst locals that the UK likes it's nuclear subs to practise in the harbour despite the fact that Ireland is a nuclear free zone.", "authorname": "doctorbob", "id": "8602872-4426660575-72157623613128910", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4426660575/#comment72157623648143332", "realname": "", "path_alias": "boourns", "author": "15104821@N06", "iconserver": "5512", "datecreate": "1268963195", "_content": "I'm so happy to see someone from this era applying such beautiful composition in this shot.... check out those reflections!!!", "authorname": "boo-urns", "id": "8602872-4426660575-72157623648143332", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4426660575/#comment72157626816657428", "realname": "Brajan Popovic", "path_alias": "brajpop", "author": "61960311@N07", "iconserver": "5270", "datecreate": "1306492866", "_content": "amazing..just amazing", "authorname": "brajpop", "id": "8602872-4426660575-72157626816657428", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4426660575/#comment72157634755529205", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66311327@N05", "iconserver": "7333", "datecreate": "1374569239", "_content": "<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=rcs&amp;q=killary+harbour&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Killary+Harbour&amp;t=h&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.597008,-9.712437&amp;panoid=f5iYJOSIdCcCT7Y8cnrvlw&amp;cbp=13,79.33,,0,-1.29&amp;ll=53.578697,-9.712601&amp;spn=0.064005,0.192947&amp;z=12&amp;source=embed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Streetview</a>", "authorname": "B-59", "id": "8602872-4426660575-72157634755529205", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "4426660575"}}
