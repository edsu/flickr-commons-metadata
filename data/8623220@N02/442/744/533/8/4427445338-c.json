As the story goes, when Finn got to Scotland and seen the enormous size of the Caledonian Giant he quickly ran back to the Antrim coast to hide.  The Scottish Giant then came looking for Finn - who in an attempt to hide dressed himself as a baby and hid in a big basket, and asked Finn's wife where he was - she told him Finn was out hunting but would be back soon.  The Giant then noticed the baby and fear came over him - if that was the size of Finn's baby then how much bigger must Finn himself be??? He then made a quick escape, in case Finn was to return, and ran home to Scotland destroying the path behind him as he went.\n\nFunnily the causeway was also used as the backdrop to the final parts of Hellboy 2!", "authorname": "Colm McCann", "id": "8602872-4427445338-72157628437721977", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4427445338"}}
