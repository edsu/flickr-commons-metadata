We had a choice back in 2000 when we first worked with the Photochrom Collection -- use the caption printed on the picture, or, the title listed in the 1905 Detroit Publishing Company sales catalog. We went with the sales catalog because it had helpful additional information like country names.  \n\nAs misspellings or out-of-date names are spotted, we weave the correctly spelled or current names into the titles, prefaced with &quot;i.e.&quot;  The published spelling  has been left in the titles to help people working from the old sales catalog find the corresponding images. But, we're beginning to experiment with parking these 'misspellings' and incorrectly identified places in the notes area.\n\nAnd, Increasingly with new projects, we rely on the captions as they appear in the original images, no matter how incomplete. The spirit of &quot;transcription&quot; helps us represent the images as their creators presented them.  Transcription can also make it easier to retrieve and compare copies of an image in different collections, or to share catalog records among libraries.  Like book cataloging.\n\nUnlike books, though, even transcribed photo titles are still likely to have misspellings and bracketed corrections.
