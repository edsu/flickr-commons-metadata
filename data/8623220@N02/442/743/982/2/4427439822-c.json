Indeed there are many magnificent views of mountains and valleys from many viewpoints which hug the coastline that leads into Glengarriff.\n\nGlengarriff is a gateway to the Ring of Kerry and Beara Peninsula and is a picturesque village with all the charm of West Cork.   There is a fantastic selection of shops, traditional bars and restaurants to choose from in this charming village where you will find a traditional warm West Cork welcome. Lots of activities also available close by golf course, water sports walking lots to do and see.\n\nGarnish Island close by is also very beautiful and should not be missed.", "authorname": "Mary Evans Lavelle", "id": "8602872-4427439822-72157623610925456", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427439822/#comment72157635452526424", "realname": "Niall McAuley", "path_alias": "gnmcauley", "author": "30369211@N00", "iconserver": "7453", "datecreate": "1378726746", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8093150526/\" title=\"&quot;... small modern church ...&quot; = Trinity Church near Glengarriff! by National Library of Ireland on The Commons, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8053/8093150526_909069793d_t.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"95\" alt=\"&quot;... small modern church ...&quot; = Trinity Church near Glengarriff!\" /></a>", "authorname": "Niall McAuley", "id": "8602872-4427439822-72157635452526424", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "4427439822"}}
