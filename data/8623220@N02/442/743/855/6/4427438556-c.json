Glengarriff is to this day a beautiful place to visit, the surrounding areas have wonderful scenery to enjoy and photograph Glengarriff \u2013 An Gleann Garbh (the rugged glen) is a name derived from the rugged beauty of the mountains and wooded valleys surrounding the village. Indeed there are many magnificent views of mountains and valleys from many viewpoints which hug the coastline that leads into Glengarriff.\n\nGlengarriff is a gateway to the Ring of Kerry and Beara Peninsula and is a picturesque village with all the charm of West Cork. There is a fantastic selection of shops, traditional bars and restaurants to choose from in this charming village where you will find a traditional warm West Cork welcome. Plenty to do in the area - golfing, water sports hill walking or simply enjoy the beauty of a wonderful place.", "authorname": "Mary Evans Lavelle", "id": "8602872-4427438556-72157623482777293", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "4427438556"}}
