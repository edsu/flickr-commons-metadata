Dublin rejoices in two cathedrals (this one and Christchurch).  There is no Roman Catholic Cathedral - the Pro-Cathedral near O'Connell Street being designated instead.  The RC church over-reached itself and purchased Merrion Square Park to build one there in the 60s.  In a remarkable display of spine the city fathers refused planning permission for a hideous structure in one of the most complete Georgian Squares in Western Europe.  Given the recent lack of morality of the RC Church it seems unlikely that there will ever be a RC Cathedral.", "authorname": "doctorbob", "id": "8602872-4427431618-72157623488434225", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427431618/#comment72157623634993408", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1268779954", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1174656@N23/\">god love</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-4427431618-72157623634993408", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427431618/#comment72157623634993974", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1268779961", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1050819@N21/\">a new world</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-4427431618-72157623634993974", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427431618/#comment72157623510424495", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1268779967", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/591987@N24/\">soulful group</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-4427431618-72157623510424495", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427431618/#comment72157623510426667", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1268779992", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/936496@N24/\">THE BEST PHOTOS OF THE WORLD</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-4427431618-72157623510426667", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427431618/#comment72157627098200188", "realname": "", "path_alias": "russianchild007", "author": "39959787@N06", "iconserver": "5338", "datecreate": "1309615304", "_content": "<b>Gesehen</b> in: <img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/2373102807_bb01b2908d.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"155\" alt=\"\" /> \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1439200@N23/\"> <b>Kirchen, Kl\u00f6ster und Kapellen (K-K-K)\nJust outstanding a shot!</b></a>", "authorname": "Josef Lex", "id": "8602872-4427431618-72157627098200188", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427431618/#comment72157634015693111", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "77975599@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1370749811", "_content": "You can always tell the architectural design of that era, with the Flying Buttress\u2019s.", "authorname": "Jonboy270", "id": "8602872-4427431618-72157634015693111", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427431618/#comment72157638520275825", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1386617812", "_content": "2007 picture with same view at <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimroyal/1483325805/\">www.flickr.com/photos/jimroyal/1483325805/</a> from Flickr user Jim Royal", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-4427431618-72157638520275825", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4427431618"}}
