Wellington was born in Ireland and when queried once on whether he considered himself to be an Irishman replied, a man can be born in a stable, but does that make him a horse?  Wellington was one of many in previous centuries who considered themselves British but were of Irish origin.  One of the interesting features of the Good Friday agreement is that this viewpoint, so long sneered at by nationalists, was accepted as being equal to the nationalist one - both North and South.\nWellington's birthplace, a magnificent townhouse on Lincoln Place, is now owned by the National Gallery of Ireland.", "authorname": "doctorbob", "id": "8602872-4427428454-72157623613059372", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427428454/#comment72157623528533571", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1269036132", "_content": "doctorbob:\n\nThank you very much for the comment and information.
