Following independence the statue was removed from the street and is usually in storage.  I saw it recently and the impact of many attacks is clearly visible as are the various attempts to restore the work.  Nowadays a charming 1960s fountain of the Four Provinces sits on this site.  As Glamborghini notes the facade dominating the view is that of the University of Dublin, Trinity College.  Trinity or TCD is the second largest and the oldest university in Ireland.  It ranks in the top 50 worldwide and has a venerable history that includes Oscar Wilde, Oliver Goldsmith, Dean Swift, Douglas Hyde, Mary Robinson and Samuel Beckett.  The college prides itself on being unorthodox and a place where not being part of the crowd is seen as an asset.  In recent years the college has expanded and grown and a greater focus on pulling in international students and talent as well as world class research has dominated.  Also the university has opened up it's Old Library to visitors so they can see many of the greatest Irish treasures including a Proclamation of the Republic and the greatest treasure of the Celts, the Book of Kells.  Not to be missed either is the Douglas Hyde Gallery, named for Ireland's first president and an institution for cutting edge art.  If you ever get to Dublin try and get a student to show you round the college.", "authorname": "doctorbob", "id": "8602872-4427428286-72157623613095422", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427428286/#comment72157623653051224", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1269035956", "_content": "Glamborghini :\n\nThanks for the additional information about this photograph.
