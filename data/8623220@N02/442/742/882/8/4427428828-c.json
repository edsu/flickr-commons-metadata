Apalling damage was done to the street as a result of the Rising of 1916 when a gunboat sailed up the Liffey to the Bridge and fired on the street.  The street was restored afterwards and today looks, if anything, more impressive.  Film of the Rising in 1916 shows new trees having been planted in the centre of the street and these were all removed in the past decade as the architects' department of Dublin City Council decided to 'improve' the street and rebrand it as a boulevard in the French style.  Dubliners were horrified at the loss of the mature London Plane trees which had housed a massive population of wagtails and other birds.  What is striking today in walking the street is the vast diversity of people from all parts of the world who now call Dublin home.", "authorname": "doctorbob", "id": "8602872-4427428828-72157623613034676", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427428828/#comment72157623488637723", "realname": "david king", "path_alias": "wavy_kinger", "author": "44204209@N03", "iconserver": "2688", "datecreate": "1268511906", "_content": "2 weeks before the I R A  blew up the piller I paid my 6d up I was 12 at the time.", "authorname": "wavy dave", "id": "8602872-4427428828-72157623488637723", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427428828/#comment72157625449468138", "realname": "stephen doyle", "path_alias": "stephendoyle", "author": "32747856@N08", "iconserver": "3227", "datecreate": "1290473233", "_content": "Amazing shot!!", "authorname": "stephendoyle1981", "id": "8602872-4427428828-72157625449468138", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427428828/#comment72157632896306626", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "79549245@N06", "iconserver": "8129", "datecreate": "1362215557", "_content": "This is the building with the dome on the right of your photo - just after the 1916 Rising,  Everything back to the river is destroyed.\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/8491917382/]", "authorname": "DannyM8", "id": "8602872-4427428828-72157632896306626", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "4427428828"}}
