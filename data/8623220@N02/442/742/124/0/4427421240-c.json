A wonderful site made even more so by the existence of a superb cake shop nearby.  Killarney hosts Ireland's largest National Park which came to the nation through American generosity.  In my humble opinion the lakes, the trees, the incomparable wildlife and the sense of remoteness make a landscape that is truly magical.  The best way to see it is with a compass, a map and lots of rain clothes and a big wooly jumper.  Stunning countryside.", "authorname": "doctorbob", "id": "8602872-4427421240-72157623488602077", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4427421240/#comment72157623526500001", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1269011813", "_content": "Thanks doctorbob, for the additional information about this location.
