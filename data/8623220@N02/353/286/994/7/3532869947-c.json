The application appears to have been filled out by someone other than the signatory, however, so perhaps it is not as reliable as it first appears.\n\nSo I went back and searched for more evidence.   The 1900 US Census of Bible Grove IL includes a Clyde M Wood, son of Leander Wood, who was born in January 1885.  The 1910 Census of the same place also has &quot; C M Wood, aged 25, teacher&quot; who appears to be the same individual. \n\nKeep the pictures coming Pete.
