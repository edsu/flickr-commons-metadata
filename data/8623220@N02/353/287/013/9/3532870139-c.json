The US Navy originally purchased the &quot;SYLPH&quot; in June 1898 from her builder, John Roach &amp; Co., Chester, PA, and they commissioned the vessel as a Presidential Yacht on August 18, 1898 at the Norfolk Navy Yard.  The &quot;SYLPH&quot; served in this capacity for Presidents McKinley (1898-1901), Roosevelt (1901-1909), Taft (1909-1913) and Wilson (1913-1921).\n\nIn 1921, the Navy re-designated her as Patrol Yacht &quot;PY-5&quot; and she sailed on the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers.  In 1925, she was permanently moored at the Washington Navy Yard, where she remained until her decommissioning in April 1929.  \n\nFrank B. Clair of Brooklyn, New York purchased her in November 1929 (Mr. Clair was reportedly an ex-bootlegger.)

She continued fishing from Sheepshead Bay until April 1939, when she changed her business and ran a ferry service from Sea Gate, Brooklyn to the Battery in Manhattan. \n \nHere she is as a commuter ferry circa 1938:\n<img src=\"http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/12130503.jpg\" />\n\n\nAlas, in 1941, her owners defaulted on the mortgage held by the Worthington Diesel Company and they took possession of the vessel.
