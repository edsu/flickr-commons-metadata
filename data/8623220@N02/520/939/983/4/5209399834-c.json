His knowledge of the rules enabled him to turn the 1908 National League pennant race around, as a result of the infamous Fred Merkle play. He helped lead the Chicago Cubs to four National League pennants and two world championships. After joining Boston in 1914, Evers sparked another turnaround when the Miracle Braves rose from the cellar in July to a world championship in October.", "authorname": "El Gato Negro", "id": "8602872-5209399834-72157625347185469", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "5209399834"}}
