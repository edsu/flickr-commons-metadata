Before being purchased by the Navy, the ship briefly served as United States Army transport ship USAT Havana and was in the first United States convoy of ships to sail for France during World War I. In her Navy career, Comfort made three transatlantic voyages, bringing home over 1,100 men from European ports. Comfort was placed in reserve in September 1919, decommissioned in 1921, and sold in April 1925.", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-4733196672-72157624233309269", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4733196672/#comment72157624285871875", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1278138299", "_content": "My great grandparents and my granduncle used this ship for several crossings between Havana and New York City.
