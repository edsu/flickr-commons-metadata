Natera was also present (because he was trying to confer Carranza in Sonora, but American authorities declined to let him pass through El Paso).  Villa proposed Toribio Ortega, or as a courtesy, P\u00e1nfilo Natera to take command of the army.  The generals chose Natera.  The column departed from Chihuahua on December 22, 1913.  On January 2, 1914 villistas were on sight to Ojinaga, on January 4ht town was attacked without success.  Then Villa took command of the army.  His plan was a nocturnal raid: Rosal\u00edo Hernandes by the south; Maclovio Herrera and Trinidad Rodr\u00edguez  by east; by the West Toribio Ortega. On January 11th at sunset, the raids went simultaneously.   The federals (huertistas), leaving fire arms, crossed Rio Bravo and surrendered to American authorities. Villa and his revolutionary army stayed in Ojinaga three or four days, then they returned to Chihuahua.  (Pedro Salmer\u00f3n, La Divisi\u00f3n Del Norte).
