It is fitting that his estate lies in the heart of polo country, Old Westbury. During the 1920's he was a polo player of distinction. His mansion was built in 1914 and later expanded in 1930.  At the age of 82,  Francis Skiddy von Stade passed away in the mansion he had built. After his 1967 passing the mansion became home to the Enternmanns family, of bakery fame.  For quite some time it has sat abandoned and decaying. Recently demolition has begun. At the time of article's publication the mansion is still standing, but an indoor horse circuit, and stables have been leveled. Another beautiful spot on Long Island will make way for more McMansions.", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-8210464891-72157632078391713", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8210464891/#comment72157632078407253", "realname": "", "path_alias": "trialsanderrors", "author": "76204898@N00", "iconserver": "5538", "datecreate": "1353687045", "_content": "The wife is identified as Kathryn Steele in a previous Bain photo:\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7949420080/]", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-8210464891-72157632078407253", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8210464891/#comment72157632091352734", "realname": "Sergei Polishchuk", "path_alias": "sergei1971", "author": "54461094@N00", "iconserver": "214", "datecreate": "1353786514", "_content": "Great image, love cars too!", "authorname": "vostok71", "id": "8602872-8210464891-72157632091352734", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8210464891/#comment72157632107428896", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pete_loc", "author": "34911459@N08", "iconserver": "3094", "datecreate": "1353945014", "_content": "trialsanderrors: thank you for the background information and names.
