He was also known as &quot;Tom Brown,&quot; a name he gave himself when he spent a week in the Auburn Prison in New York state in 1913.\nIn an assessment of Osborne's life, a New York Times book reviewer wrote: &quot;His career as a penologist was short, but in the interval of the few years he served he succeeded in revolutionizing American prison reform, if not always in fact, then in awakening responsibility.... He was made of the spectacular stuff of martyrs, to many people perhaps ridiculous, but to those whose lives his theories most closely touched, inspiring and often godlike.&quot;", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-6482047975-72157628349761683", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6482047975/#comment72157628351656719", "realname": "Bernie", "path_alias": "olddognewtrick", "author": "76774906@N00", "iconserver": "22", "datecreate": "1323474694", "_content": "He had to play to a tough crowd.", "authorname": "OldDogNewTrick", "id": "8602872-6482047975-72157628351656719", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6482047975/#comment72157628354241899", "realname": "", "path_alias": "southernbreeze", "author": "93477485@N00", "iconserver": "5528", "datecreate": "1323494914", "_content": "The bad old days...
