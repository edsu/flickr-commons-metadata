He left his fortune to this second wife, and not to his children; Croker's children tried to claim that the Croker-Edmonson marriage wasn't valid, but they were unsuccessful in proving their claims.  The will was still being contested as late as 1937.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Croker\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Croker</a>\nShe's buried in West Palm Beach, FL, where she owned a lot of beachfront property in later life:\n<a href=\"http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=62332174\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=62332174</a>", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-6482033205-72157628348084527", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "6482033205"}}
