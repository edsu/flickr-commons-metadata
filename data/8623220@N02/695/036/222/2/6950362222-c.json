Moffit choose the address '86' because it was the year he graduated from Cal Berkeley (Mario Palestini, personal communication). For many years J. K. Moffitt was president of Crocker Bank and served as a U.C. Berkeley regent. A great book collector, he left the first large bequest to the Bancroft library ($100,000). \n<a href=\"http://www.verlang.com/sfbay0004ref_wp_5.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.verlang.com/sfbay0004ref_wp_5.html</a>\nGot $5,150,000 to spare?
