The marriage ceremony which was witnessed only by a few friends and relatives of the couple, was followed by a reception at Sunridge Hall, the country residence of the bride\u2019s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Steele. A special train from New York carried many guests to the reception and the hunting set of Long Island was well represented. The news of the engagement in June came as a surprise, as few outside of the immediate families of the young couple knew that a deeper sentiment than a mutual interest in sports existed between them. Miss Steele\u2019s father is a member of the firm of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Milburn is a member of the Meadowbrook, the Aero and the Racket and Tennis Clubs. He was graduated from Oxford in 1903 and from Harvard in 1906. He was star of the American polo team in England in 1909 and again in 1910 and distinguished himself in the last international series. He has long been noted for his daring horsemanship.", "authorname": "The Bees Knees Daily", "id": "8602872-4408110059-72157629963703862", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4408110059/#comment72157630017032512", "realname": "Barbara", "path_alias": "barbara_loc", "author": "33593953@N02", "iconserver": "3267", "datecreate": "1338671128", "_content": "Thanks for the information about the event (and for including your source!).
