It was not Abbot's intention to provide a &quot;hospital&quot; in the modern sense of the word but a place of shelter for the elderly poor of the town - 12 single men and 8 single women - under the care of a resident Master. Nearly 400 years after the first residents moved in, Abbot's Hospital continues to offer town centre accommodation within a sociable and supportive environment for local elderly people..\n\nA magnificent Jacobean building listed Grade 1, Abbot's Hospital is opposite Holy Trinity Church where George Abbot is buried and is just yards away from Abbot's memorial statue at the junction of Upper High Street.&quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-8622366370-72157633181223668", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "8622366370"}}
