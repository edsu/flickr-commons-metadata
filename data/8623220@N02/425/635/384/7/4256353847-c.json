He served as mayor of the City of New York from 1910 to 1913, as well as stints as a New York Supreme Court Justice from 1893 to 1909.\n\nEarly in his term, Gaynor was shot in the throat by James J. Gallagher, a discharged city employee. Gaynor remains the only New York City mayor to suffer an assassination attempt. ... Although Gaynor quickly recovered, the bullet remained lodged in his throat for the next three years. During his term as mayor, Gaynor was widely considered a strong candidate for Governor or President. Tammany Hall refused to nominate him for reelection to a second term, but after accepting the nomination from an independent group of voters, he set sail for Europe. Six days later, on September 10, 1913, Gaynor died suddenly from the lingering effects of the shooting.", "authorname": "No\u00ebl Zia Lee", "id": "8602872-4256353847-72157623042783425", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4256353847/#comment72157623045073185", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "21686909@N07", "iconserver": "2188", "datecreate": "1262995427", "_content": "Lingering effects of the shooting?
