The evidence here is most persuasive. You have convinced me that the Lusitania was the setting of Haldane's shipboard portraits.\n\nThe New York Times story of August 30, 1913, explains that reporters (and presumably, photographers) came aboard the Lusitania on August 29, as it was detained briefly in quarantine [at Ellis Island(?)] before docking in New York Harbor. Viscount Haldane was affable, even humorous, as he allowed himself to be interviewed by the press. That would have been when the Bain cameraman had his chance to shoot the full-figure pose and the two closeups.\n\nNew York Times story, August 30:\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E05E4DC113CE633A25753C3A96E9C946296D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E05E4DC113CE6...</a>", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4257086948-72157625100616219", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4257086948"}}
