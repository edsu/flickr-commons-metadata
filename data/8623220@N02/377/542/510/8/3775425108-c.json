He was a member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg. As one of the few elected monarchs, Haakon quickly won the respect and affection of his people and played a pivotal role in uniting the Norwegian nation in its resistance to the attack and five-year-long Nazi occupation during World War II. In Norway, Haakon is regarded as one of the greatest Norwegians of the twentieth century and is particularly revered for his courage during the German invasion - when threatening abdication if the government cooperated with the invading Germans - and his leadership and preservation of Norwegian unity during the Nazi occupation. He died at the age of 85 in 1957, after having reigned for nearly 52 years.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haakon_VII_of_Norway\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haakon_VII_of_Norway</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-3775425108-72157625281981911", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3775425108/#comment72157625285480757", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1290003635", "_content": "Richard Arthur Norton:  Thanks for the information on the King of Norway and his family.
