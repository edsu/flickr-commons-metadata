I drove past it last weekend on my way back from Rhinebeck, New York. \n\nThe Poughkeepsie Bridge (sometimes known as the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge, the Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge, the High Bridge, or, since October 3, 2009, the Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park) is a steel cantilever bridge spanning the Hudson River between Poughkeepsie, New York on the east bank and Highland, New York on the west bank. Built as a double track railroad bridge, it was completed on January 1, 1889, and went out of service on May 8, 1974.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poughkeepsie_Bridge\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poughkeepsie_Bridge</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-8124824154-72157631858489055", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "8124824154"}}
