Between 1914-1919 she was used as a troopship and resumed commercial sailings to Australia on 20th July 1920. From 1928 she came under the management of White Star Line and operated London - Brisbane on the Aberdeen Line - White Star - Blue Funnel joint service. Transferred to Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line in 1932 after the collapse of White Star, she started Liverpool - Australia sailings in June.
