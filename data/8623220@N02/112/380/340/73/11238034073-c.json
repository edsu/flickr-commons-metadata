Eight soldiers and ten civilians were killed. Under General John J. Pershing, the regiment fought in the Mexican Expedition from 1916 to 1917, which was a response to the attack on Columbus. On April 12, 1916, about 100 men of the 13th Cavalry engaged Mexican federal troops in the Battle of Parral. During the fighting, two Americans were killed and six others were wounded. However, they defeated the Mexicans, killing at least a dozen of them or possibly many more.[2] The 13th Cavalry remained ready near the Mexican border until 1921.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_Cavalry_Regiment_(United_States)\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_Cavalry_Regiment_(United_States)</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-11238034073-72157638423360976", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "11238034073"}}
