He was the sport's 19th Yokozuna from 1903 till 1914. His great rivalry with Umegatani T\u014dtar\u014d II created the &quot;Ume-Hitachi Era&quot; and did much to popularise sumo. He is remembered as much for his exploits in promoting the sport as for his strength on the dohy\u014d. In his later years as head coach of Dewanoumi stable he trained hundreds of wrestlers, including three yokozuna. Many consider him the most honorable yokozuna in sumo history, which earned him the nickname &quot;Kakusei&quot; (\u89d2\u8056), or &quot;sumo saint&quot;.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachiyama_Taniemon\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachiyama_Taniemon</a>\n\n&quot;Umegatani T\u014dtar\u014d II (\u6885\u30f6\u8c37 \u85e4\u592a\u90ce, March 11, 1878 \u2013 September 2, 1927) was a sumo wrestler from Toyama City, Toyama Prefecture, Japan.
