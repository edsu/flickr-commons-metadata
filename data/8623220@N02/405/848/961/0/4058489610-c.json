He was considered the finest American orator at a time when keynote speakers at such momentous events as the dedication of the Gettysburg Cemetery were expected to speak for a couple of hours.  It was Lincoln who jarred the crowd by uttering a few words, then sitting back down before the audience had settled in.  Many who were present thought that Lincoln, in his brevity, showed disrespect to the occasion.  Most journalists covering the event dismissed Lincoln's speech as a sidenote hardly worthy of mention (Lincoln was, after all, a last minute invitee to the event; Everett was the advertised keynote speaker).  Only when Lincoln's speech was reprinted as a circular did the public come to realize the brilliance of his words.  Thus, only in hindsight, do we look back at Lincoln and Everett on that day and dismiss Everett as the &quot;windbag.&quot;  The folks who saw them speak at Gettyburg that day saw it very differently.", "authorname": "thetallguy747", "id": "8602872-4058489610-72157622765048946", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4058489610/#comment72157622640997539", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1257740577", "_content": "True, and most in the crowd who went that day to see the great men were unable to hear the utterances of either of them.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4058489610-72157622640997539", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4058489610"}}
