I picked last from the roster of major league stars.\nAll the big names had been picked.Babe Ruth,Lou Gehrig,Joe Dimaggio,Stan Musial and Ted Williams. \nThe one player that was left that i really thought looked pretty good was Johnny Mize. He was a giant and i not only picked him but every other Giant player in that board game. \nMy catchers were Roger Bresnahan,and Walker Cooper. Joining Mize at first base was Bill Terry. Frankie Frisch was at 2nd. Fred Lindstrom was at the hot corner,and my outfield was Bobby Thomson,Willard Marshall,and for some reason i cant remeber the other or my shortstop.\nChristy Mathewson and Carl Hubbell headed my pitching staff.\nIt was a mixture of all time greats and current 1947 stars.\nThat 1947 year the real Giants finished 5th. Then in '48 they were 4th. 1949 saw them in 3rd and 1950 they were second to the Phillies whiz Kids.\n1951 was my year. At the end of that season the Giants were tied for first with the hated Dodgers.\nThen in the last playoff game Bobby Thomson hit the homerun that sent them to the worls series.\nI hope you enjoyed my trip down memory lane.", "authorname": "Ol'redneckbassfisherman", "id": "8602872-4017163772-72157622521267249", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4017163772"}}
