McGraw and Mack had known each other for years, and McGraw accepted it graciously. By 1909, the A's were wearing an elephant logo on their sweaters, and in 1918 it turned up on the regular uniform jersey for the first time. Over the years the elephant has appeared in several different colors. It is currently forest green. The A\u2019s are still sometimes, though infrequently, referred to as the &quot;Elephants&quot; or &quot;White Elephants.&quot;\n\nThe elephant was retired as team mascot in 1963 by then-owner Charles O. Finley in favor of a Missouri mule (it was also rumored to have been done by Finley in order to attract fans from the then heavily Democratic constituents of Missouri by replacing the traditional Republican mascot to one associated with Democrats). In 1988, the elephant was restored as the symbol of the Athletics and currently adorns the left sleeve of home and road uniforms. The Elephant Mascot returned briefly in the mid-'80s, under the name Harry Elephante. In 1997, the elephant returned, taking its current form: Stomper.", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "8602872-6243431602-72157627782656611", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6243431602/#comment72157627934293828", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1319071769", "_content": "Another Bain photo of Garry Herrmann:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4627029952/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-6243431602-72157627934293828", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6243431602"}}
