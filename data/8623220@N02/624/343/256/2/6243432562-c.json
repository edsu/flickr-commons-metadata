You are right, considering that Princess Ileana was born in January 1909 and is clearly still quite young in this photo, so her mother was Crown Princess Marie at the time, not Queen.  This photograph was likely acquired by the Bain News Service in October 1914 when she became Queen of Romania. It was not uncommon for Bain to use older portrait photographs in this way.  In the interest of preserving the archival record, we try to leave Bain's given titles (in this case, Queen of Rumania), but we can add more information to the record to clarify that this photo dates from an earlier year.", "authorname": "Kristi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-6243432562-72157627957428513", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6243432562"}}
