It does seem that Bain had a habit of finding earlier photographs - often of European royals - for use in the paper when something significant happened, like a crowning or other event.  \n\nThe sticker on the upper left corner of this image has a very faint 1914 date and perhaps October or November as the month. King Albert of Belgium was in the news quite a bit in the last part of 1914 as he was personally leading the Belgian army in their battle against the invading German forces.  Numerous articles in U.S. newspapers speak about the battles fought, his injuries and his heroics, so it is not surprising this image might have appeared in the papers. (For example, a Nov. 12, 1914 article in the Chicago Tribune is titled King Albert of Belgium a Hero of All Europe.)\n\nI checked the original photograph of Anna Held you cited with the name of the photographer and completely agree that this is the same signature, and is for Aime Dupont.  King Albert would have been a 22 year old prince in 1898, which does seem right for the photo here, and that Dupont was a Belgian photographer is a good point. \n\nWith all of this in mind, we will add more information to the record.  Thanks again for the diligent research!", "authorname": "Kristi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-6243434280-72157628099873640", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6243434280"}}
