Unlike her sisters, <i>Olympic</i> served a long and illustrious career (1911 to 1935), including service as a troopship during World War I, earning the nickname &quot;Old Reliable.&quot; For a short time she was the largest ocean liner in the world.\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163900354/]\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Adriatic_(1907)\" rel=\"nofollow\">RMS <i>Adriatic</i></a> (1907&ndash;1935) was an ocean liner belonging to the White Star Line. She was the fourth of a quartet of ships measuring over 20,000 tons, dubbed The Big Four, and the only one of the four which was never the world's largest ship. But she was the fastest and the biggest of all Big Four. She was as big as her sister, RMS <i>Celtic</i>, and nearly identical in outward appearance. She was the first ocean liner to have an indoor swimming pool and Turkish bath.\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5818139846/]", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-5817571829-72157626929382670", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5817571829/#comment72157626932006230", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "29079609@N02", "iconserver": "5491", "datecreate": "1307743684", "_content": ".", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-5817571829-72157626932006230", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5817571829/#comment72157626985749080", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1308354822", "_content": "Other Bain photos of the departure of the &quot;Adriatic&quot; from New York harbor, August 8, 1914:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5818139846/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5818139960/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5818140178/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5817571829-72157626985749080", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5817571829"}}
