Minnehaha</a> was a 13,443-ton ocean liner built by Harland and Wolff and launched on 31 March 1900. Operated by the American-owned Atlantic Transport Line, she was the sister ship of SS Minneapolis, SS Minnetonka, and SS Minnewaska.\n\nIn her first year of operations, the Minnehaha collided with and sank a tug in New York Harbor on 18 September 1900. The tug suffered two fatalities. On 18 April 1910, the liner grounded on rocks on Bryher in the Isles of Scilly while en route from London to New York; she remained stranded until 13 May when two tugs managed to pull her off the rocks. The cattle on board were saved by swimming them onto the island of Samson, Isles of Scilly where there was temporary pasture; no lives were lost.\n\nOn 7 September 1917, Minnehaha sank within four minutes after being torpedoed by German U-boat U-48, with 43 fatalities. Her sister ships Minneapolis and Minnetonka were scuttled while in use as troop transports during World War I.\n\nNamed after the fictional American Indian woman:\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/trialsanderrors/3959138560/]", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-5818139736-72157626805148953", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5818139736/#comment72157626808081467", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1307752075", "_content": "Another Bain/LOC photo of the Minnehaha:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5818136752/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5818139736-72157626808081467", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5818139736/#comment72157626808230417", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "15283643@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1307754198", "_content": "The tug is named &quot;Downer X&quot; (X = roman numeral 10?).
