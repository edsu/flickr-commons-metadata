This appears to be a photo of <b>Helie</b> who was married to <b>Anna Gould</b> (the American heiress from Tarrytown, NY).  There are several photos of her and her house are on Flickr LoC collection, try the tags.\n\nArticle on Anna Gould from Wikipedia:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Gould\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Gould</a>\n\nAnna's 2nd husband was <b>Helie de Talleyrand-Perigord</b> (1859-1937) <b>Prince de Sagan</b>. He is also known as Le Marquis de Talleyrand Perigord, Duc de Sagan.  This looks like it is a photo of <b>Helie</b> (age 53 in 1912) holding their son <b>Howard</b>.  Sadly, Howard later would shoot himself in his mother's apartment when annoyed with his mother when she told him he could not get married (he was then 19) because she would not give her permission until age 21.  (see citation in Wikipedia article).  Howard was born in 1909, so he would be around 3 if this photo is from 1912.  Howard died at age 19 in 1929.  Father Helie died in 1937 at age 78.", "authorname": "Harry Angstrom", "id": "8602872-2555568213-72157605472929131", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2555568213/#comment72157605599237591", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "27560047@N06", "iconserver": "3262", "datecreate": "1213393286", "_content": "looks like the prince is wearing a poodlehair coat! cute pic!", "authorname": "sadlers8", "id": "8602872-2555568213-72157605599237591", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2555568213"}}
