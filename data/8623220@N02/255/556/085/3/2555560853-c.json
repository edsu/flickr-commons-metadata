In 1912, both the Republican and Bull Moose (Progressive Party) conventions were held at the same Chicago Convention Hall. Both conventions had delegates from various states. Roosevelt attended both conventions, but he was humiliated at the GOP gathering and lionized later at the Bull Moose conclave. Although women did not yet have the vote, they were included in the councils of the Progressive Party. The presence of several women delegates in this photo makes it likely that this is the &quot;Bull Moose&quot; convention.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2555560853-72157622394650339", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2555560853"}}
