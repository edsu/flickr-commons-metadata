From the site above: &quot;HMS Victory has now been in commission for over 200 years and is the oldest commissioned warship in the world.&quot;  A major restoration effort is currently under way.  So she is currently in drydock and without her topmasts.  See <a href=\"http://www.historicdockyard.co.uk/news/news393.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.historicdockyard.co.uk/news/news393.php</a>\n\nI recently learned that during the Napoleonic Wars, French prisoners of war were housed in hulks of ships in Portsmouth and one of their occupations was to make models of ships.  With the assistance of guards and officers, they traded the ships and got commissions for models of particular ships.  I saw one of the Victory in the maritime museum in Oinousses, Greece (a small island in the Aegean) a few weeks ago, and <a href=\"http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/15617/lot/364/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bonhams.com/auctions/15617/lot/364/</a> shows another that was auctioned in 2007.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-9368724671-72157634803831417", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9368724671/#comment72157634830007883", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "33546386@N03", "iconserver": "2807", "datecreate": "1375046254", "_content": "Excellent", "authorname": "excellentzebu1050", "id": "8602872-9368724671-72157634830007883", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9368724671/#comment72157634873320614", "realname": "", "path_alias": "brize", "author": "25453448@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1375261491", "_content": "It is a truly moving experience to go round this ship (now a tourist attraction) and learn how the men - and boys, yes -  lived, sailed, fought the enemy, and died on board this fighting machine - and of course, about Nelson and the Battle of Trafalgar.", "authorname": "Darkroom Daze", "id": "8602872-9368724671-72157634873320614", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "9368724671"}}
