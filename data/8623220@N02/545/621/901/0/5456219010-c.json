(3069-3) might be linked to pictures call nrs. 3069-4, 3069-6 and 3069-7 that are most likely corraled last days of March or beginning April, 1914 .  It seems that the wrecked house on the back ground is the same seen in &quot;HOUSES DESTROYED BY HAND GRANADES, LERDO  3069-6&quot; in Bain's collection.  \nIn 1913 Ocaranza probably was second in command to General Ignacio A. Bravo and in 1914 to General Jos\u00e9 Refugio Velasco, for the federal operations in Torre\u00f3n garrison, (Laguna District) where the powerful Divisi\u00f3n del Nazas was stationed. \nAlso there's another article in New-York Tribune, issue March 29, 1914 that says:\n&quot;General Eduardo Ocaranza, reported killed, was fatally wounded in Lerdo battle...&quot;\n(Rebel General Maclovio Herrera assaulted Lerdo (Durango State, 7 miles west to Torre\u00f3n) on March 23-24, 1914.\nDr. Roberto Duarte\nPlastic Surgeon", "authorname": "jerodamor@yahoo.com.mx", "id": "8602872-5456219010-72157629449510507", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "5456219010"}}
