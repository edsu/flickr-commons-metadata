However, I am not sure if the film was taken at the same time as the photo.  Their clothes look similar, but the locations may be different and perhaps these are their traveling outfits. Could the Bain photo been taken in NYC and the Pathe film in England?  The Pathe film archive is fascinating, and may be helpful for identifying other Bain images.

Can't match up any backgrounds, except that both seem to be taken at a ship.  The clothes are almost identical--even the fob-like thing attached to Roy's breast pocket, and the arrangement of Clara's furry stole--but I'm looking again right now and see that Joy's coat is different--could be a lighter layer under the heavier coat here, but maybe it really is just a different day.  Same traveling clothes for most of the party, but a different day.\n\nI like the theory that they're taken at both ends of the same trip, New York and England.  That would make a lot of sense.  The children look the same age/size and are wearing the same hats, etc., so the photo and the footage have to be taken in the same year or so, even if they're not from the same moment.  I assume the children didn't cross the Atlantic more than once or twice a year (but maybe that's my own parenting experience talking!).", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-5456217398-72157626011083015", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "5456217398"}}
