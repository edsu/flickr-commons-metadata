The serial nr. 3069-4 locates the photo after april 1914. And if photo 3069-7 says: &quot;Torre\u00f3n, federals going to battle&quot; it seems likely that Lerdo reffers to one of the three main cities of the Laguna district (Torre\u00f3n [in Coahuila State, south to Nazas River], G\u00f3mez Palacio and Lerdo [in Durango State at the northern edge of Nazas River])\nDr. Roberto Duarte", "authorname": "jerodamor@yahoo.com.mx", "id": "8602872-5455608167-72157626106863419", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5455608167/#comment72157626907984589", "realname": "Jes\u00fas Roberto Duarte", "path_alias": "jesusduarte", "author": "53461717@N08", "iconserver": "4116", "datecreate": "1308872564", "_content": "Assault to Lerdo took place on March 23-24, 1914,  by the brigade commanded by Maclovio Herrera. from the city south-west, as part of what is known as &quot;La Batalla de Torre\u00f3n&quot; .
