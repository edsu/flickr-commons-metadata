So by April 4th &quot;Fererals were not going to battle&quot;, they WERE ON RETREAT TOWARDS SAN PEDRO DE LAS COLONIAS (northeast from Torre\u00f3n) where they had a clash on April 7 with Villa\u00b4s fore troups.  The main Villa\u00b4s army began a wholesale atack on San Pedro, which became fearce and bloody on April 10 and generalized in the evening between 12 and 13 (03:30 hrs).  Then Velasco ordered retreat. Possibly this picture was taken at San Pedro federals arrival (?).\nCheck Robert Runyon's   <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.award/txuruny.00222\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.award/txuruny.00222</a>         &quot;Constitutional(ist) [revolutionaries on Villa's command] Cavalry awaiting orders to atack&quot;  Those horsemen are photographed inside of Torre\u00f3n, in front of west side of Alameda Zaragoza, by April 6, 1914.
