Rees, one of the best Civil War era photographers in the South. As captain of a local militia unit, the Howard County Dragoons, Gaither led a group of landowners, many of whom owned slaves, and assisted with peacekeeping in Baltimore during riots in 1861. When pressed to swear allegiance to the United States, most refused, gathered their weapons, rode to Leesburg, Virginia, and joined the Confederate Army. Gaither was captured at Manassas Junction on August 27, 1862, later exchanged, and sent to Europe the next year on a mission for the Confederate government. Following the war, he became a cotton trader.\nDeposit; Tom Liljenquist; 2011.\n\n<b>Subjects:\n</b> Gaither, George Riggs,--1831-1899.\nConfederate States of America.--Army.--Virginia Cavalry Regiment, 1st--People.\nSoldiers--Confederate--1860-1870.\nMilitary uniforms--Confederate--1860-1870.\nUnited States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Military personnel--Confederate.\n\n<b>Format: </b> Portrait photographs--1860-1870.\nAmbrotypes--Hand-colored--1860-1870.\n\n<b>Rights Info: </b> No known restrictions on publication.\n\n<b>Repository: </b> Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA, <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/pp.print\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/pp.print</a>\n\n<b>Part Of: </b> Ambrotype/Tintype filing series (Library of Congress) (DLC)   2010650518\nLiljenquist Family collection (Library of Congress) (DLC)   2010650519\n\nMore information about this collection is available at <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/pp.lilj\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/pp.lilj</a>\n\n<b>Higher resolution image is available (Persistent URL): </b> <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ppmsca.31430\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ppmsca.31430</a>\n\n<b>Call Number: </b> AMB/TIN no. 5057\n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "2457", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1861-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1379131280", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1330702737"}, "originalsecret": "845d2bb9ff", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7204", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6946553269/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
