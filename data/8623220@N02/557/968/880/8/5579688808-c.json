In 1902, for example, college play was so rough that several players died, while others were severely injured -- a crisis that provoked intervention by then-President Theodore Roosevelt. (The 18th-century militia outfits were 1908's costume du jour, and had no connection with the gridiron theme.)\n\nOther Bain/LOC photos of the 1914 Yale Class Day activities:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5579689450/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5579103547/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5579689162/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5579689048/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5579103099/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5579102805/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5579688808-72157626408673714", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5579688808"}}
