Glynn was New York's first Catholic governor. He was not re-elected in 1914, so his term of office was brief. Suffering from chronic pain, he committed suicide in 1924. \n\nJohn Huston Finley was New York's Commissioner of Education from 1913-1921, among many other prominent academic posts. \n\nI'm afraid I don't recognize the building.", "authorname": "carljohnson", "id": "8602872-5579689890-72157626406430204", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5579689890/#comment72157626282472565", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1301686376", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Huston_Finley\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Huston_Finley</a>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Henry_Glynn\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Henry_Glynn</a>\nThe building is:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York</a>\nWhere Finley was president in 1913.", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-5579689890-72157626282472565", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5579689890/#comment72157626310064277", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anne_loc", "author": "35014516@N03", "iconserver": "3087", "datecreate": "1302016278", "_content": "carljohnson and Richard Arthur Norton:  Thank you the additional information!
