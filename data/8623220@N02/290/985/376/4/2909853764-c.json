In 1868 he graduated from Yale (where he was a member of the secret Skull and Bones society) and received an MA in 1871. Granted deacon's orders at Berkeley Divinity School in 1872, he served in churches in Connecticut, Michigan, New York, and Maryland before being named Bishop Coadjutor of Connecticut in 1897, the same year he received a Doctorate of Divinity from Trinity College. He was the Bishop of Connecticut from 1899 to 1928.
