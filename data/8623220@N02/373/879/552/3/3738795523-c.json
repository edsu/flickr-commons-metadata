He was euphemistically known as &quot;Dry Dollar&quot;, as the &quot;Big Feller&quot;, and, later, as &quot;Big Tim&quot; (because of his large stature). During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, he controlled much of the city's criminal activities between 14th Street and the Battery in New York City.
