Now a days this street runs  south-north from Arcos de Bel\u00e9n to Ju\u00e1rez.  In the corner with Victoria there used to be located a fortress-like building which was Mexico City Police Headquarter.  Across Arcos de Belen heading south, the street takes the name General G. Hern\u00e1ndez up to Dr. R\u00edo de la Loza, where C\u00e1rcel de Belem (Belem Prison) was located (today there is found PGJ building [Procuradur\u00eda General de Justicia]).  It was most likely taken in February 1913, during the 10 Tragic Days (Decena Tr\u00e1gica) when both buildings were warded by federals.  Quite near was the Ciudadela (Fire arms mill), which was sieged and heavy combats took place. Although trees on background make believe they are close (two or three blocks) to La Alameda.  So for that, is the most likely position, therefore is Revillagigedo between calle Nuevo M\u00e9xico (today Art\u00edculo 123), behind the camera and Calle Independencia on the background.\nDr. Roberto Duarte\nPlastic Surgeon", "authorname": "jerodamor@yahoo.com.mx", "id": "8602872-4176258363-72157627826452716", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4176258363/#comment72157629094449089", "realname": "Jes\u00fas Roberto Duarte", "path_alias": "jesusduarte", "author": "53461717@N08", "iconserver": "4116", "datecreate": "1327904751", "_content": "There's a photo that was taken practically at the same time and slightly the same angle so we can say both pictures are &quot;twins&quot;.
