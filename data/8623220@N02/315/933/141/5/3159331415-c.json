Alexander Jackson Davis was the architect. Financier Jay Gould bought it as a summer home in 1880. After his death it became the home of his eldest daughter, Helen, and, on Helen's death, his younger daughter Anna took charge of the property. Anna left Lyndhurst to the National Trust for Historic Preservation on her death in 1961. Today it is a museum.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.lyndhurst.org/\">Lyndhurst web site</a>.\n\n<b>Edit:</b> The web site New York Social Diary provides <a href=\"http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/node/2279\">this extensive page</a> featuring many modern photographs of Lyndhurst and its grounds.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-3159331415-72157612070399285", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3159331415/#comment72157612190583911", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1231252695", "_content": "Whyaduck: thank you for the information about Lyndhurst.
