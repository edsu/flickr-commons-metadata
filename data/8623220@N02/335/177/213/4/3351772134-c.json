March 1969) - Baptized 11 DEC 1881 at 3rd Presbyterian Church, Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Pennsylvania Alice Cornelia (Thaw) Seymour Whitney; in a much talked of international match, she became the Countess of Yarmouth. She married George Francis Alexander Seymour (20 October 1871, d. 16 February 1940), the son of Hugh de Grey Seymour, 6th Marquess of Hertford and Hon. Mary Hood, on 27 April 1903 in Pittsburgh. It is said that the earl extorted money from her at her wedding and promptly deserted her. Her marriage to George Francis Alexander Seymour was annulled in 1908. He was styled Lord Hertford; he died in 1940, aged 68 and childless, and his titles passed to his nephew. Later (before 1914), Alice Thaw became Mrs. Geoffrey G. Whitney (Geoffrey Gordon Whitney was born July 21, 1882 in Boston). Their estate was at Woods Hole. &quot;\n\nThe engagement announcement on December 19, 1912 <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D03E4DA1E3AE633A2575AC1A9649D946396D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D03E4DA1E3AE633A...</a>\nhas a different middle initial for her future husband, but her May 1955 obituary at <a href=\"http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A14F8345B167B93C2A8178ED85F418585F9\">select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A14F8345B167B...</a> (subscripton required), gives his name as Geoffrey G.
