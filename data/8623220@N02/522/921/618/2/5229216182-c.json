It appears he is wearing normal civilian clothes and is holding a civilian hunting rifle. That is certainly no musket he is holding though it may be a fowling piece. Very few smooth bored hexagon or octagon barrels. The ramrod is longer than the barrel and obviously made out of wood. Military arms stopped having wooden ram rods by 1730-40. How is it not possible that he is just Joe Shmoe with his hunting arm? Its even possible he is a Union militia or home guard citizen.", "authorname": "Captain_Cogle", "id": "8602872-5229216182-72157625564396058", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "5229216182"}}
