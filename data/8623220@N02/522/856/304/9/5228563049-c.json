This photograph is a tintype. Most tintype images appear reversed because the photographer made a positive image on a sheet of iron (no negative was involved).  However, some cameras had  mirrors or a 45 degree prism which would correct the image. Photographers could also re-photograph the image to get a &quot;correct&quot; view.
