It is indeed possible this is a Confederate soldier wearing a Union captain's uniform, which is why the title makes sure to separate the soldier (i.e. 'unidentified soldier') from the uniform (i.e. 'in Union captain's uniform'). It's fair to say the uniform is that of a Union captain, but not so easily determined if the man wearing it is a captain himself!", "authorname": "Kristi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-5228554615-72157625446004957", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5228554615/#comment72157626727096427", "realname": "John Hartsock", "path_alias": "buckeye616", "author": "60894293@N00", "iconserver": "42", "datecreate": "1306857681", "_content": "It looks as if this very young man has a smooth chin and cheeks, but a shadow on his upper lip.
