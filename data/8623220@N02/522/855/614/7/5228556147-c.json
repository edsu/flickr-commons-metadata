Because the prewar military establishment of Maine fielded no cavalry of reflemen, large waist belt plates and small cartridge box plates were not necessary.  These plates were purchased at some point between the adoption of a state button in 1855 and the outbreak of war in 1861.  The Army had switched to large waist belt plates by 1857 but a number of states adhered to the old pattern through 1862.  A considerable quantity of this style was acquired as many have been recovered from the battlefields and camps of Virginia.&quot;*\n\n&quot;The Volunteer Militia of Maine (VMM), as it was formally named, was organized in 1851 and restructured in 1861 to raise and equip ten regiments of volunteer infantry for two years of Federal service.  It appears that most of these men were initially outfitted by the state with VMM plates in accordance with the Army's 1839 regulations.&quot;*\n\n*Michael J. O'Donnell &amp; J.
