At the outbreak of hostilities, BOTH sides wore Blue and Grey interchangeably. At First Manassas, 1861, Sherman was commanding a cavalry unit, which wore grey, a PA Zouave Regiment was wearing grey. Several companies of the 33rd Virginia Regiment (Stonewall Jackson's) were wearing Mexican War era blue frocks as pictured above.", "authorname": "jmc33vavols", "id": "8602872-5228586839-72157625412853331", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "5228586839"}}
