The 1st and 3rd division colors, for all Corps badges, were red and blue, respectively, and would be seen as much darker in these old black and white photos.  \nThe 2nd Division of the 2nd Corps is noteworthy for being at the stone wall during Pickett's Charge.", "authorname": "shipraider06", "id": "8602872-5228583717-72157625621079726", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5228583717/#comment72157625623259354", "realname": "Fred Hall", "path_alias": "fredhall", "author": "14775694@N04", "iconserver": "3093", "datecreate": "1292679031", "_content": "It wasnt Hooker who developed/designed the actual badges. He might have instituted them officially though.\n\nThis is what is said bout corps badges on General Philip Kearnys wiki-site.\n\nKearny is credited with devising the first unit insignia patches used in the U.S. Army. In the summer of 1862, he issued an order that his officers should wear a patch of red cloth on the front of their caps to identify themselves as members of his unit. The enlisted men, with whom Kearny was quite popular, quickly followed suit of their own volition. Members of other units picked up on the idea, devising their own insignia, and these evolved over the years into the modern shoulder patch. (Daniel Butterfield is credited with taking Kearny's idea and standardizing it for all corps in the Army of the Potomac, designing most of the corps badges.) Kearny was promoted to major general on July 4, 1862.", "authorname": "Fred Hall", "id": "8602872-5228583717-72157625623259354", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5228583717/#comment72157625514355287", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1292872559", "_content": "Fred Hall and shipraider06:\n\nThanks for your comments and further identification!
