So, there's  another explanation for the stripes. \n\nSmith was enrolled in the 52nd Virginia Infantry 15 July 1861 at age 18, and was 4th Sergeant, Company B. He served with them until February 1862, when he furnished a substitute and was discharged (3 March). It is likely, then, that the photo here was taken between July 1861 and March 1862.\n\nHe enlisted as Private in the 1st Cavalry in either the spring of 1863 or early 1864.  He was wounded in action at Kennon\u2019s Landing (24 May 64), then in hospital in Richmond and on furlough into September. He returned to his unit and was paroled at Staunton, Virginia in May 1865. For most of his life he was a farmer and merchant near Waynesboro, where he is buried at Riverview Cemetery.\n\nRoster sources: Robert Driver's histories in the H.
