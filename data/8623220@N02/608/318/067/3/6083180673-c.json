As a member of the famed $100,000 infield, Baker helped the Philadelphia Athletics win the 1910, 1911 and 1913 World Series. His legacy has grown over the years, and he is regarded by many as the best third baseman of the pre-war era.\nContents [hide]\n1 Professional career\n1.1 Philadelphia Athletics\n1.2 New York Yankees\n1.3 Managerial career\n1.4 Legacy\n2 See also\n3 References\n4 External links\n[edit]Professional career\n\n[edit]Philadelphia Athletics\n\n\nHome Run Baker\nHe was born in Trappe, Maryland, was a butcher by trade, and broke into the major leagues in 1908 with the Athletics.\nBaker, who led the American League in home runs in 1911, earned the nickname &quot;Home Run&quot; during the 1911 World Series in which he hit a go-ahead home run off Rube Marquard in Game 2, and a ninth-inning game-tying home run off Christy Mathewson in Game 3. His home run crown would be the first of four consecutive seasons leading the American League in home runs. He hit 11 home runs in 1911, 10 home runs in 1912, 12 home runs in 1913, and nine home runs in 1914. In two of those seasons he also led the American League in runs batted in.\nIn seven seasons with the A's he hit .321 with 48 home runs, 612 RBIs and 88 triples in 866 games played.\nBaker played third base for the Athletics until 1915, when he sat out the entire season in a contract dispute with Connie Mack. He remained in baseball, playing for Upland, Pennsylvania in the semiprofessional Delaware County League.[1]\n[edit]New York Yankees\nMack sold Baker's contract in 1916 to the New York Yankees, with whom he finished his career. He led the league in games played with 141 games in 1919\nInitially, Baker retired in 1920, but came back to play two more seasons with the Yankees, seasons that took him to two more World Series. He finished his tenure with the Yankees with a .288 batting average, 46 home runs and 375 RBIs in 676 games.\n[edit]Managerial career\nFollowing his retirement, Baker managed for two seasons (1924-1925) in the Eastern Shore Baseball League, and was credited with discovering Jimmie Foxx and recommending him to Athletics manager Connie Mack.\n[edit]Legacy\nIn addition to his 1955 election to the Baseball Hall of Fame, in 1981 Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.\nHome Run Baker was laid to rest in Easton, Maryland.\nThere is a statue of Home Run Baker in the southwest area of UMass-Amherst. It was erected by a University of Massachusetts student.\n[edit]See also\n\nList of Major League Baseball players with 100 triples\nList of Major League Baseball leaders in career stolen bases\nHitting for the cycle\nList of Major League Baseball RBI champions\nList of Major League Baseball Home Run Records\nList of Major League Baseball home run champions\nList of Major League Baseball triples champions\nMajor League Baseball titles leaders\n[edit]References\n\n^ Lanctot, Neil (1994).
