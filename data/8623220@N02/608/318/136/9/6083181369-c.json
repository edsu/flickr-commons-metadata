It is home to the 5th Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group.\n\nCFB Valcartier was originally erected as a military training camp in August 1914 as part of the mobilization of the Canadian Expeditionary Force at the onset of World War I. The site was also used as an internment camp for &quot;enemy aliens&quot;, mainly eastern Europeans. The name Valcartier comes from the town of Saint-Gabriel-de-Valcartier, of which a large section was expropriated in order to create the military training camp. Due to its proximity to the Port of Quebec, Valcartier became the largest military camp on Canadian soil, including some 32,000 men and 8,000 horses.\n\nA Franco-Canadian WW1 recruitment poster:\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/trialsanderrors/2971018603/]", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-6083181369-72157627525584216", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6083181369/#comment72157627526382390", "realname": "", "path_alias": "cameliatwu", "author": "40999618@N05", "iconserver": "3539", "datecreate": "1314402977", "_content": "Beautiful series of photos", "authorname": "CameliaTWU", "id": "8602872-6083181369-72157627526382390", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6083181369/#comment72157627402833669", "realname": "yves", "path_alias": null, "author": "40259805@N02", "iconserver": "3751", "datecreate": "1314415301", "_content": "The chubby one really stands out LOL", "authorname": "Mr Abraham Lincoln", "id": "8602872-6083181369-72157627402833669", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6083181369/#comment72157627527260108", "realname": "brian donovan", "path_alias": null, "author": "58621196@N05", "iconserver": "7141", "datecreate": "1314415480", "_content": "lol", "authorname": "brdonovan", "id": "8602872-6083181369-72157627527260108", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6083181369/#comment72157627404175777", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "55466266@N04", "iconserver": "4129", "datecreate": "1314436793", "_content": "Nice<img src=\"http://s04.flagcounter.com/map/rzN/size=s/txt=FFFFFF/border=FFFFFF/pageviews=0/viewers=3/\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><img src=\"http://s04.flagcounter.com/count/rzN/bg=ffffff/txt=ffffff/border=ffffff/columns=1/maxflags=1/viewers=0/labels=0/.jpg\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><img src=\"http://2.s04.flagcounter.com/count/rzN/bg=ffffff/txt=ffffff/border=ffffff/columns=1/maxflags=1/viewers=0/labels=0/.jpg\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />", "authorname": "\u266b Lion \u266b", "id": "8602872-6083181369-72157627404175777", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6083181369/#comment72157627532260874", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1314477073", "_content": "Note to LOC and others: This photo was NOT &quot;taken circa 1910&quot; -- it was taken in 1914, after the outbreak of WWI.\n\nOther Bain/LOC photos of the Valcartier Camp:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5963840851/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5964397822/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-6083181369-72157627532260874", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6083181369/#comment72157627409005481", "realname": "", "path_alias": "trialsanderrors", "author": "76204898@N00", "iconserver": "5538", "datecreate": "1314488469", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/70251312@N00] I think that's the purpose of this exercise, to help the LOC sift through a massive pile of photographs and provide a context for each picture from all of the resources we can access.", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-6083181369-72157627409005481", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6083181369/#comment72157627431712389", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jon_loc", "author": "63860770@N07", "iconserver": "2794", "datecreate": "1314730258", "_content": "Thanks trialsanderrors and Wystan, we'll correct the spelling and update the date range.", "authorname": "Jon (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-6083181369-72157627431712389", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "6083181369"}}
