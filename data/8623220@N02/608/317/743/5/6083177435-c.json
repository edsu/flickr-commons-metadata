I think the letter after the 'Y' is a backward 'N'. The people at Bain wrote on the back side of the negative in black pen (the letters show up white when the negative's color is reversed). Since they were on the back side they had to write the letters reversed in order for it to show up correctly in the photograph. I guess the writer in this case forgot to flip the 'N'. In some of the Bain negatives, they didn't even try to write backwards so all the text is reversed. I'll ask that they add Brooklyn Team to the title.", "authorname": "Jon (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-6083177435-72157627431912035", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "6083177435"}}
