He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953. Bender was born in Crow Wing County, Minnesota as a member of the Ojibwa tribe - he faced discrimination throughout his career, not least of which was the stereotyped nickname (&quot;Chief&quot;) by which he is almost exclusively known today.\n\nA portrait by Paul Thompson:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/trialsanderrors/2826245542/]", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-6083179057-72157627401244385", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6083179057/#comment72157627562618950", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1314805582", "_content": "If it's 1913 and the Polo Grounds, it's probably the 1913 World Series:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.seamheads.com/baseballgauge/year.php?yearID=1913&amp;tab=1a\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.seamheads.com/baseballgauge/year.php?yearID=1913&amp;...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6083179057-72157627562618950", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6083179057"}}
