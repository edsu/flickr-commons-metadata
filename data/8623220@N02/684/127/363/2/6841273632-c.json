In most of these photos, the subject assumes a fixed position with the arms usually resting firmly somewhere or otherwise supported.  There were also portrait customs which dictated that the subjects of a portrait like this shouldn't be smiling or showing teeth. The father in this one is in a chair, the older daughter on a bench, supported by leaning against him.  His head tilt slightly away from her could also be partly due to the saxhorn between them, sticking up over his shoulder.\nBecause of those issues, I don't read a whole lot into this about their relationship.", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6841273632-72157629621118849", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6841273632"}}
