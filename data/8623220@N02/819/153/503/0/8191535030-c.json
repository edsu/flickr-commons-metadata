This was not a Morse airplane, but an airplane carrying a Morse, Erwin A. Morse, son of Charles W. Morse, New York financier and shipbuilder. Edwin Morse intended to start air service between Albany and New York at the 132d Street Pier. On the first day of service, July 11, 1915, he and his pilot hit a log or railroad tie floating in the North/Hudson River, and the plane flipped over.  Neither was seriously hurt.\nThe New York Tribune ran a flippant account, accompanied by a picture of the wreckage being towed to the dock by a rowboat.   The &quot;flying boat&quot; was made by The Wright Co. in Dayton, Ohio, for the Hudson=Wright Aero Company.\n<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1915-07-12/ed-1/seq-14/;words=Erwin+A+Morse?date1=1913&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=basic&amp;state=&amp;date2=1922&amp;proxtext=erwin+a.+morse,+&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;index=4\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1915-07-12/ed-...</a>\nThe company had also announced in June that their flying school was opening at the 132d street pier.\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=st1LAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA566&amp;ots=44sivi59Bf&amp;dq=hudson-wright aero&amp;pg=PA566#v=onepage&amp;q=hudson-wright aero&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=st1LAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA566&amp;...</a>\n\nHere is the account from the New York Evening Telegram:\n&quot;AEROPLANE UPSETS IN\nRIVER: TWO RESCUED\n-\u2022\u2022-\nErwin A. Morse and A. B. Gaines Have Narrow Escapes When Machine Strikes Log and Turns Turtle on First Albany to New York Passenger Trip.\n\nIn the sight of thousands of persons along the North River to-day, a hydro-aeroplane In which were A. B. Gaines and Erwin A. Morse,&quot; son of Charles W. Morse, was disabled and turned turtle In the middle of the stream. Both men were rescued by boats which put out quickly\nfrom the shore, and the machine, which did not sink, was towed in to a pier. \nThe accident marred what was intended to be the inauguration of a regular hydroaeroplane passenger service between this city and Albany. Mr. Morse, who is manager of the\nHudson Navigation Company, is interested in the new project and went in the aero-plane as a passenger. The machine was piloted by Mr. Gaines. They intended to fly to Albany and left the hangar at the foot of West 132d street at eight o'clock.\nMr. Gaines had previously made a short flight to test the machine and had found\neverything all right. When he left the water for the long flight the pilot sent the\nmachine up about thirty feet, then started off at a sixty mile an hour speed. After\ngoing a short distance at this height, Mr. Gaines decided to come down within five or six feet of the water.  In makingthe dip the bow of the hydroaeroplane struck a log.  The keel of the machine was split and a wing broken and it immediately turned over in the water.\n\nMr. Morse was thrown into the river and started to swim for shore, but Mr.Gaines clung to the wreckage. The machine was then about in the middle of tne river. Crowds that had gathered to watch the flight saw the accident and there was great excitement. Dozens of launches and\nrowboats from the yacht clubs along the shore put out to the rescue. A launch\nfrom a private yacht that was anchored well out in the stream was the first to\nreach the men and take them aboard. The victims of the mishap were landed\nat West 132d street and the machine was towed to a point a short distance away.\nJust at this time the steamboat Rensselaer, of the Hudson Navigation Company,came along on its trip from Albany and the two men got aboard and went down to pier No. 32, where Mr. Morse has living quarters.\n\nAfter a change of clothing the two men had breakfast. Mr. Morse took his experience\nas a minor mishap and said he would start again as soon as the machine was repaired.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers 6/New York NY Evening Telegram/New York NY Evening Telegram 1915 Jul -Aug Grayscale/New York  NY Evening Telegram 1915 Jul -Aug Grayscale - 0184.pdf#xml=http://fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=d27e8e8&amp;DocId=5135786&amp;Index=Z:\\Index I-E&amp;HitCount=8&amp;hits=4da+4db+4dc+4e0+5c2+74d+764+79a+&amp;SearchForm=C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Fulton_New_form.html&amp;.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%206/New%20York%20NY%20Evenin...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-8191535030-72157632049074659", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8191535030/#comment72157632069691253", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66311327@N05", "iconserver": "7333", "datecreate": "1353584108", "_content": "Good find, artolog, thanks!", "authorname": "B-59", "id": "8602872-8191535030-72157632069691253", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "8191535030"}}
