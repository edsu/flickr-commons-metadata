It was designed by the architect Richard Morris Hunt, and said to be inspired by the Petit Trianon at Versailles (which it resembles in little more than pilasters and balustrades). Its temple-front portico, which also serves as a porte-coch\u00e8re, has been compared to that of the White House. Grounds were designed by noted landscape architect Ernest W.
