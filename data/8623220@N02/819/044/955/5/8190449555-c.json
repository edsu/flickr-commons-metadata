Peg is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Wing Bock of Newark, N. J. Of course one wonders why, if her father's name is Bock, she is called O'Wing.  The Chinese do things which we Americans seem to be puzzled over.  It is because her father and mother are Chinese that her name is O'Wing.  That signifies daughter of Wing....&quot;\n\nStory goes on to explain that she looks a bit &quot;Spanish,&quot; and that she's looking for an American husband.  &quot;Miss O'Wing will be the only Chinese actress in the United States...She speaks Italian, Chinese, German, and French, as well as English, and she feels that an American of her ideal type will appreciate her more asa wife, than a Chinaman.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cdnc/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SN19151127.2.78&amp;cl=CL2.1915.11&amp;srpos=0&amp;dliv=none&amp;st=1&amp;e=-------en-logical-20--1-----all---\" rel=\"nofollow\">cdnc.ucr.edu/cdnc/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SN19151127.2.78&amp;...</a>", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-8190449555-72157632030591562", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8190449555/#comment72157632044340961", "realname": "", "path_alias": "can_", "author": "37039158@N04", "iconserver": "2137", "datecreate": "1353312156", "_content": "nice story...", "authorname": "\u7f50\u982d\u5132\u85cf\u5f0f", "id": "8602872-8190449555-72157632044340961", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8190449555/#comment72157632077889259", "realname": "Barbara", "path_alias": "barbara_loc", "author": "33593953@N02", "iconserver": "3267", "datecreate": "1353682181", "_content": "Thanks for the background information and links!
