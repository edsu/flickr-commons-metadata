The club was a counterpart to the city\u2019s famed Coaching Club, many members of which were husbands, fathers, and brothers to the members of the Ladies\u2019 Club. The Ladies\u2019 Club took regular trips to the different boroughs as well as longer road trips to destinations in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut; for a short time they even ran a small shuttle service through Manhattan.  Under the tutelage of renowned driving instructor Morris Howlett, most of the members became quite accomplished drivers.  Each year, the Club held a parade and review through Central Park onto Fifth Avenue.  The Club\u2019s founder and president was Helen Benedict Hastings, wife of the famous architect Thomas Hastings, designer of the New York Public Library, the front fa\u00e7ade of the U. S. Capitol Building, and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington Cemetery.  Other notable members of the Ladies\u2019 Club included Mrs. Arthur Iselin (vice president), Louisa Gulliver Sheldon (secretary and treasurer), Marion Hollins, and Harriet Alexander.  The Club flourished until automobile traffic on the city streets made coaching impossible.&quot;", "authorname": "Shaybraham Lincoln", "id": "8602872-3295498010-72157614156728194", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3295498010/#comment72157614161671558", "realname": "Nathan Adams", "path_alias": "captainslack", "author": "18753752@N00", "iconserver": "154", "datecreate": "1235158980", "_content": "Great hats!", "authorname": "captainslack", "id": "8602872-3295498010-72157614161671558", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3295498010/#comment72157614162234796", "realname": "", "path_alias": "antiphonfotos", "author": "24246413@N00", "iconserver": "86", "datecreate": "1235160217", "_content": "Women driving a coach?
