Despite his nickname, he was not a Mexican national but a fourth generation Californian. He was a lightweight boxer whose ring career lasted from 1910 to 1923. \n\nIn 1912, he fought <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/tags/adwolgast/\">Ad Wolgast</a> for the lightweight title. At the beginning of the thirteenth round, he and Wolgast both landed punches that sent the other down. Wolgast fell on top of Rivers, and referee Jack Welch helped Wolgast to his feet and began the count on Rivers. Welch declared Wolgast the winner by a technical knockout, in one of the most controversial decisions in the history of boxing.\n\nA video of the last thirty seconds of the famous &quot;double knockdown&quot; fight can be seen at <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/jcbunnell/movie/\">this web page</a>.\n\nRivers had another shot at the lightweight title the next year when he fought <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/tags/willieritchie/\">Willie Ritchie</a>, who had taken the title from Wolgast in November, 1912, but Ritchie knocked him out in the eleventh round.\n\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950DE5DC153FE633A25756C0A9619C946296D6CF\">Here's the New York Times article</a> about the 1913 Rivers-Ritchie fight.\n\nFollowing his ring career, Joe Rivers played bit parts in a few movies, and was technical adviser on one of them. <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0729539/\">Here's his IMDb page</a>.\n\nDespite having made what was, for the time, a considerable fortune in the ring, Rivers' money eventually began to run out, and late in his life he was living in a windowless room in downtown Los Angeles. That's where L.A. Times reporter Frank Finch interviewed him in 1955, as told in <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/25/sports/sp-50168\">this Times article</a> from 1999, on the 42nd anniversary of Joe Rivers' death.\n\nJoe Rivers is buried at Calvary Cemetery in East  Los Angeles.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-3295493136-72157614130183671", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3295493136/#comment72157624980557259", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1286337048", "_content": "I added the above biography to Wikipedia:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Joe_Rivers\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Joe_Rivers</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-3295493136-72157624980557259", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3295493136"}}
