(note the all important period) was intended as an abbreviation rather than a pejorative, what is there to correct?  \n\nI may be wrong, but I don't believe the term 'Jap', uttered as a pejorative, was in wide currency until the Second World War, some thirty years after the photo was taken.  The catalog card may not have been filled out in 1910, but must nonetheless have been written up well before the war.  Incidentally, during the First World War, which of course took place not long after 1910, Japan was an ally of the US and Britain, a fact that renders it much less likely that the notes accompanying the image were contemptuous in meaning.\n\nDuring the Second World War some very ugly racist propaganda directed at the Japanese was promulgated by the US Government and by news media.  The newspaper headlines, the Movietone News reels, the ubiquitous war propaganda posters all were ridden with the most offensive and racially charged imagery and wording.  As distasteful as these effusions of hatred are to us today, they are nonetheless historical documents.  They are reminders of aspects of American history that, while they do not make us proud, should not be ignored.  \n\nWhereas the desperate GI fighting tooth and nail against the tough Japanese garrison of some shell-blasted atoll can be forgiven for stooping to slinging racial epithets with his bullets and grenades, the attitudes engendered in the comfortable US civil populace by wartime propaganda are much more unsettling (see Vonnegut).  The resultant ill treatment of Japanese-Americans, most especially the outright theft of their homes and possessions, was indeed a shameful chapter in US history.  \n\nWe know what attitudes pervaded US society during WW2, but what of the earlier decades of the 20th Century?  Did a photographer or a file clerk really evince contempt for the Japanese in 1910?  Or did one of those people innocently abbreviate the word Japanese to Jap., just as he or she employed Calif. for California?  This is not unimportant, and the file card in question, written upon by a long dead hand nearly a century ago, may provide us a window, however tiny, on the sensibilities of the time.  Let us not, please, run through the archives with a marker, blotting out anything that may just possibly give offense.  Anyone with a genuine interest in history wants to hear the whole story, good and bad, and not some polished official version.\n\nAgain, I draw your attention to the .
