Among his many ring opponents (he fought more than 100 bouts) were Joe Rivers and Joe Thiel, both of whom are depicted in other Bain photos posted today.\n\nAnother boxer named Joe Mandot was a featherweight born in Mexico who had about two dozen bouts in Southern California, from 1922 to 1928, but given the time frame of photos in this collection, I'd say he's not likely to be the boxer depicted in this photo.\n\nBoxRec's website is down this evening, so I can't check for more  details of his career right now, but <a href=\"http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=11872&amp;cat=boxer\">Here's a link to &quot;Baker Boy&quot; Joe Mandot's bout list there</a> for when the site starts working again.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-3294669267-72157614176838294", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3294669267/#comment72157624965643877", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1286160860", "_content": "I started a biography for him in Wikipedia:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Marceline_Mandot\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Marceline_Mandot</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-3294669267-72157624965643877", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3294669267"}}
