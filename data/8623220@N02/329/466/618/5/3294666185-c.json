There was the Brooklyn barbers' strike of 1913, and there was the New York barbers' strike of 1914.\n\nHaving searched the New York Times' accounts of the era, I suggest that the occasion shown in this photograph is Joseph J. Ettor speaking to the striking Brooklyn barbers at Union sqaure on May 16, 1913.\n\nHere is the New York Times account from printed the following day:\n\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F00E5DF143FE633A25754C1A9639C946296D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F00E5DF143FE633A...</a>\n\nIn that account, it also states that, &quot;There were not many mottoes displayed at the gathering, but one of those displayed read, &quot;We were slaves.  Now we want to be free.&quot;  Another read: &quot;The Industrial Workers of the World lead this strike.  This means success.&quot;.&quot;\n\nThis second slogan, &quot;The Industrial Workers of the World lead this strike.  This means success.&quot; can be made out on the sign at left of photograph just behind the column.  I'll put a note on the pic highlighting that.\n\nFor what little it is worth, here is the wikipedia bio of Joseph J. Ettor:\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Ettor\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Ettor</a>\n\nThe photograph of Ettor at that wikipedia page also helps to identify him in this photograph.", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "8602872-3294666185-72157614173349228", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3294666185/#comment72157614392771750", "realname": "Lewis Wyman", "path_alias": "lewis_loc", "author": "34876228@N04", "iconserver": "3450", "datecreate": "1235508237", "_content": "Fascinating!
