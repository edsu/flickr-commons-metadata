A pince-nez had no arms or temples and clipped on the bridge of the nose. It was held in place by either spring powered nose guard grips in the fingerpiece type or a spring bridge with nose guard grips in the hoopspring or C bridge type. Properly fitted, a pince-nez remained securely attached to the bridge of the nose at all times and was very comfortable even during full time wear. Eyeglasses (pince-nez) and spectacles (glasses with temples) : were unisex then. The terms eyeglasses and spectacles had distinct meanings. The rimless type was the most popular and stylish for all ages. For soldiers,it was great for wear under a gas mask or goggles and army officials stated the a pince-nez was the ideal eyewear. \nSee Pince-nez Renaissance blog/site the only place on the web or anywhere for very detailed,accurate info re: pince-nez.Click on table of contents.
