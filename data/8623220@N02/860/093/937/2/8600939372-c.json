Many of its rooms still contain the fireplaces and window seats used by the College's first students, while its stairwells are decorated with the original stained glass windows. \n\n&quot;Merion's exterior stonework was recently repointed and the copper detailing replaced. New bedroom spaces were added to the fourth floor in Summer 1998 to complete the hall's renovation.&quot;\n\nMerion Green, a portion of which is shown in the foreground, above, is the &quot;center&quot; of campus, and serves as the main venue for outdoor events, including picnics, dances, concerts, carnivals, May Day, Commencement and Reunion. \n&nbsp;\nA Maypole can be seen in the above photo. May Day is an all-day celebration (and a major Bryn Mawr tradition) that occurs the Sunday after the last week of classes. The entire college community comes together for a day of medieval festivity, Maypole Dancing, and a general good time.  Each class gets a Maypole in its class color.
