(&quot;Bet A Million&quot;) Gates, pioneer manufacturer of barb wire, who (with the help of Judge Elbert Gary) grew the wire manufacturing industry into a monopoly, which became part of Andrew Carnegie's U. S. Steel Corporation. Charles Gates was a free spender, who boasted that he gave away a million dollars a year, just in tips. He was also addicted to speed, and several times raced in private trains across the continent to set speed records for long distance travel. One such exploit took place in July, 1913 -- a fast trip from his home in Minneapolis to New York City, where he had a seat on the Stock Exchange. &quot;The most sensational of all the stories in which Charles G. Gates has figured,&quot; said the New York Times in its obituary, &quot;was a report from Minneapolis last July that he had been thrashed in a restaurant by Frank Hopwood, his father-in-law.&quot; That report pursued Gates to New York, where on his arrival he denied the story, and said that he would return to Minneapolis and thrash the person who launched the rumor, if he could identify him.

An uncropped version of this image was copyrighted in 1903 by someone other than Bain. It was used in 1911 for a news story about Gates traveling from Yuma, AZ to New York on a special train. The date written on a Bain negative may represent the date it was made or it may represent a later date, perhaps when it was acquired or used.  It makes sense that the photo may have been acquired or used to illustrate Gates' exploits in July 1913.  The date on the negative sometimes corresponds to the date it was taken but not always.
