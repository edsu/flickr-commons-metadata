He was raised to the rank of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system in 1902; and he was promoted to the rank of admiral in 1904.\n\nAs Minister of the Navy during the Russo-Japanese War, Yamamoto showed strong leadership and was responsible for appointing T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d as commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet. He gave voice to T\u014dg\u014d's reports when he read his aloud his reports from the war to the assembled Diet.[2]\n\nYamamoto was elevated to hakushaku (count) in 1907.\n\nCount Yamamoto served as Prime Minister in 1913-14.&quot;\n\n(ref. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamamoto_Gonnohy%c5%8de\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamamoto_Gonnohy%c5%8de</a> )\n\nThis photograph was almost certainly taken on July 10 or on July 11, 1907.
