It's helpful to know what likely made the photo newsworthy for the Bain News Service. There is another copy of this photograph in the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3b47712\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3b47712</a> submitted for copyright on March 13, 1913 by &quot;The Elliotts.&quot;  This photograph appears to have been copied by the Bain News Service.  The smudge on the lower right corner is where the Elliott signature appeared. The  negative is marked with two dates in the upper left corner.  A Bain file print of this photo is annotated &quot;June 18, 1913 To proceed against New Haven Road for Violation of Anti-Trust Act&quot; so the 6/30/1913 date may relate to this event. The second date, 1/30/24, corresponds to the date that Gregory was named by President Coolidge as Special Council for the Oil Inquiry to investigate what was later to be referred to as the Teapot Dome Scandal.  We'll add Gregory's fuller name and the date to the description when we update it.", "authorname": "Brett (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-3681835861-72157621108424447", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3681835861"}}
