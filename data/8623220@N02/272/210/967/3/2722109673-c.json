This does appear to be Ebbets Field, and seems to have been taken while it was still being completed. (Note the seats being installed on the lower deck along the far end of the right field stands.) It was the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League, so while the original caption is correct in a sense, the addition of Ebbets Field to the description would be a helpful one.  We'll add that information to the source data and reload it to Flickr.", "authorname": "The Library of Congress", "id": "8602872-2722109673-72157606580759125", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2722109673"}}
