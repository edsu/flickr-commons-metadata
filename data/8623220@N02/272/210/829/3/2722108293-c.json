Cannot tell if it identifies the other man.  The photograph almost certainly was taken at Madison Square Garden, where the B&amp;B show opened every Spring.  A check with Circus World Museum's index would reveal what years Barrett was with that show.", "authorname": "WolfFoley", "id": "8602872-2722108293-72157623112234465", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2722108293/#comment72157624676999413", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1282699524", "_content": "Another Bain/LOC photo of the circus midget, Jack Barnett, with unidentified man:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2722108075/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2722108293-72157624676999413", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2722108293/#comment72157627004595187", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11914939@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1309943615", "_content": "Sorry to keep correcting you all.
