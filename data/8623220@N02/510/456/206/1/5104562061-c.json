Juan Manuel Cascales, Toluca, Mexico, 1911 \u2013 d. New York, 1968) was a noted arranger in the 1940s-'60s, with perhaps his best known work for Stan Kenton's orchestra. \n\nPart of a musical Mexican family that immigrated to Los Angeles, he was working as a saxophonist by 1930. As John Cascales, he featured as jazz tenor man on west coast radio programs in the mid '30s. A brother, Carlos Cascales aka Chuck Cabot, led his own orchestra starting in 1940. \n\nRichards joined Stan Kenton's arranging staff in 1950 and relocated to New York City by 1952, continuing to work for Kenton's band until he died of a brain tumor in 1968. He was also composer of the hit tune &quot;Young at Heart&quot; (1953).", "authorname": "TheConnCave", "id": "8602872-5104562061-72157631567882355", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "5104562061"}}
