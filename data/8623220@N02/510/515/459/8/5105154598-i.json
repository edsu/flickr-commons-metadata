Boyd, the enfant terrible of the movement, made a surprise four-day visit to New York from the Coast for no better reason than that his backer happened to have had a $300 credit with an air line.  At the moment, Boyd hasn't actually got a band; but he does have that backer.  Soon as a location is wrangled, the Boyd will fly.  Stan, meanwhile, is killing them with his Artistry album and winning most of the crowns that last year went to Woody Herman.\n\n<b>Notes:\n</b> Gottlieb Collection Assignment No. 509\nReference print available in Music Division, Library of Congress.\nPurchase William P.
