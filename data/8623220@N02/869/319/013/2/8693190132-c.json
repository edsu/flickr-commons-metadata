The pair of peaks in the centre are the Langdale Pikes.  The left one of the pair is Pike of Stickle and the right one is Harrison Stickle.  Behind it, to the right, is Pavey Ark.  The steep valley coming down the nearer side of Harrison Pike is Dungeon Ghyll.  The view is taken from Kettle Crag I think, looking NNW. The long sloping shoulder on the L is The Band - well known hikers' slog up on to Bow Fell (out of view to L), or knee-breaking descent from same.  The ridge on the skyline is Rossett Pike.  These mountains always look impressively Alpine in views like this, in spite of being only about 700-800 m a.s.l.  Langdale is a classic glaciated valley with Pavey Ark above it, a classic glaciated cirque (aka corrie, cwm) with the Dungeon Ghyll a classic hanging valley - all text-book examples.  The rocky topography is formed in Ordovician volcanics dating from when the Lake District was part of an island arc.  (Lake District place names are truly poetic - many of them are said to be Norse origin, from when the Vikings settled the area.)", "authorname": "Darkroom Daze", "id": "8602872-8693190132-72157633382478424", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "8693190132"}}
