Angle of Stamford CT was accused of killing Waldo R. Ballou.  Her studio apartment in the Rippowam Building was at the top of a flight of stairs; Waldo's body was found at the bottom of those stairs, dead from a skull fracture.  The theory was that she pushed him down the stairs.  The building belonged to Helen's father, Leonard Blondel, who proposed that perhaps the man fell, or a thug attacked Waldo on the stairs, and Helen's dress became bloodstained when she tried to help him.\n\nShe was acquitted.  In the process she became reacquainted with her ex-husband.  They were divorced in 1910, but remarried in 1915, after the trial.", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-5764552083-72157626819543692", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "5764552083"}}
