US reserves of gold had been sinking at the rate of $2 million a day and reached a low of $40 million at one point. By 1914 things were in pretty good shape but then war broke out and everyone went off the gold standard. The gold standard wasn't restored until 1925 and didn't last much longer after that. Today of course gold and silver are a distant memory and none of our coins are worth the zinc they're made of.", "authorname": "Jim Rees", "id": "8602872-5765106366-72157626829473766", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5765106366/#comment72157626707152567", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "29079609@N02", "iconserver": "5491", "datecreate": "1306672362", "_content": "on Lusitania's 3rd westbound voyage, Nov 3, 1907, she carried a record gold shipment of $12,361.150  (approx $250,000,000 today)  the largest gold shipment on a ship at that time, because of a sudden US Treasury demand.

I found a couple references to shipping gold bars in dry barrels. A half barrel holds about 55 l, and the density of gold is around 19, so if you filled one of these it would weigh over 1000 Kg! I suspect they put a few bars in each barrel and the rest is empty space. A standard gold bar today is 400 troy ounces or 12 Kg and measures 7 x 3-5/8 x 1-3/4 inches.", "authorname": "Jim Rees", "id": "8602872-5765106366-72157626707822157", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5765106366/#comment72157626708735255", "realname": "Jim Rees", "path_alias": null, "author": "83025347@N00", "iconserver": "50", "datecreate": "1306686600", "_content": "On second thought these are too small even for half barrels.", "authorname": "Jim Rees", "id": "8602872-5765106366-72157626708735255", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5765106366/#comment72157626879046986", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1307146773", "_content": "Other Bain/LOC photos of the process of shipping gold abroad from New York, 7/31/1914:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5764558641/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5764558475/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5765106366-72157626879046986", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5765106366"}}
