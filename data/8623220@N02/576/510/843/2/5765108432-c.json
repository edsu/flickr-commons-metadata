HMS Dreadnought revolutionized warships in 1906.  The first &quot;all big gun&quot; ship, she was the first modern battleship.  Jackie Fisher who designed her, also designed the battlecruisers, of which INDOMITABLE was the second ship.  They were originally known as armoured cruisers until they were redesignated as battlecruisers by an Admiralty order of 24 November 1911. The confusion seems quite common as they were also known as cruiser-battleship, dreadnought cruiser and battle-cruiser before the admiralty decree.  The date may be 8/10/1915.  It appears she may be coaling and/or taking on supplies.", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-5765108432-72157626696051619", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5765108432/#comment72157626820796554", "realname": "brian donovan", "path_alias": null, "author": "58621196@N05", "iconserver": "7141", "datecreate": "1306535550", "_content": "This is great.", "authorname": "brdonovan", "id": "8602872-5765108432-72157626820796554", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5765108432/#comment72157626697102427", "realname": "Maximillian Heartwood", "path_alias": null, "author": "62344762@N07", "iconserver": "5067", "datecreate": "1306548112", "_content": "This is great, awesome !", "authorname": "maximillian.heartwood", "id": "8602872-5765108432-72157626697102427", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "5765108432"}}
