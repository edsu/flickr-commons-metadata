They had long established tribes and lands that they inhabited which were unfairly taken away from them by Europeans who had absolutely no right to do so, but the whites had the might of gunpowder and also diseases such as small pox which they spread among the tribes.  I disagree with you.  The &quot;Native Americans&quot; indeed were entitled to lands they settled on because they were here before the white Europeans.  They were here for thousands of years.  They were treated miserably and their treatment was  often worse than the treatment the white Europeans gave to the black slaves of the south.   I don't care if Miles did call for fair and humane treatment of them.  It was not fair and humane to drive them from their land or to take them into custody, and certainly not to kill them if they did not give in.  His idea of &quot;fair and humane treatment&quot; was not my idea of fair and humane.   Face it, our European forefathers were nothing but avaricious bullies who felt they had a right to eradicate an entire race of people simply because they, the whites, felt intellectually and morally superior.  To them, the &quot;Native Americans&quot; were noble savages.  The white man had &quot;God&quot; on his side.  And that is another thing, it was wrong to force Christianity on these people.  They already had a &quot; natural religion of the Great Spirit&quot; and an established culture.

But, the U.S. indeed acquired millions of acres from the Native Americans by simply taking over hunting grounds and villages during the westward expansion.  The U.S. broke something in the neighborhood of 280 treaties with the natives.  No wonder they fought back and committed atrocities against the white man.  They were forced to move to reservations or further westward and then the US reduced the size of the reservations or simply forced them off reservations.  This continued into the 1960s when the US flooded a vast part of the Allegheny Reservation.  To help settle lawsuits the US allowed the Native Americans to &quot;own&quot; a certain number of casinos on their own reservation lands.  Big deal.  The US Govt stole lands from these people, took it right from under them.  \n\nNot only did the US take over reservation lands that were given to natives in treaties by the US, but this country allowed the senseless slaughter of millions of buffalo by men who simply let the animals pile up and rot on the prairies after shooting them from the Union Pacific RR.  So, a large source of  food and leather was taken away from the native Americans.  \n\nThe rest of the world turned a blind eye to what happened to the native Americans....the &quot;civilized&quot; world allowed a new nation to be built while destroying a &quot;savage&quot;, uncivilized one.   The &quot;savages&quot; were conquered and the US government has monitored immigration ever since.  People of all nationalities and countries have come here, but there have been quotas.  That is not the point.....it is a different nation now and there is no turning back.  It should never have happened in the first place.  Perhaps Henry Hudson should have paid a little more than he did for Manhattan.  Perhaps the white man should have been truly fair and offered something besides trinkets, lies and broken treaties for land here.

The federal U.S. government has always been the government that makes treaties with Indian tribes - not the states. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution states that \u201cCongress shall have the power to regulate Commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes\u201d.[3] This determined that Indian tribes were separate from the federal or state governments and that the states did not have power to regulate commerce with the tribes, much less regulate the tribes. The states and tribal nations have clashed over many issues such as Indian gaming, fishing, and hunting. American Indians believed that they had treaties between their ancestors and the United States government, protecting their right to fish, while non-Indians believed the states were responsible for regulating commercial and sports fishing.[26] In the case Menominee Tribe v. United States in 1968, it was ruled that \u201cthe establishment of a reservation by treaty, statute or agreement includes an implied right of Indians to hunt and fish on that reservation free of regulation by the state\u201d.[27] States have tried to extend their power over the tribes in many other instances, but federal government ruling has continuously ruled in favor of tribal sovereignty. A seminal court case was Worchester v. Georgia. Chief Justice Marshall found that \u201cEngland had treated the tribes as sovereign and negotiated treaties of alliance with them. The United States followed suit, thus continuing the practice of recognizing tribal sovereignty. When the United States assumed the role of protector of the tribes, it neither denied nor destroyed their sovereignty.\u201d[28] As determined in the Supreme Court case United States v. Nice (1916),[29] U.S. citizens are subject to all U.S. laws even if they also have tribal citizenship.\n\n                                     - from &quot;Tribal Sovereignty in the United States\n\nThe Mongolian conquerors you are referring to lived thousands of years after the migration of peoples who became the &quot;Native Americans.&quot;  Do you really believe that certain races of people are innately more ruthless than others?

They do not have a seat at the United Nations nor do they exchange ambassadors with foreign countries.

Indian tribes are sovereign in the same sense of the word as U.S. states are referred to as sovereign states. This is not the same sovereignty that nation states possess.
