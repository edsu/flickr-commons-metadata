This was just plain stupid.  \n\nThe players have become bigger, faster, stronger, on the whole.....pitching has become better overall because of the use of relievers and better medical/training care....fielding better due to much better gloves and better turf.  Players are in better physical condition (players were told NOT to lift weights before the sixties).  Balls are wound tighter and go farther (especially  when hitters are on steroids).  Let's just hope the majors NEVER go to metal bats.", "authorname": "budderflyman", "id": "8602872-3490810581-72157628395899975", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3490810581"}}
