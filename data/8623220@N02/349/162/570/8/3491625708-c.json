He was the first player to ever &quot;steal&quot; first base.  And he did it at least one other time.  MLB finally invented a rule to prevent it from happening again, in 1920, but Herman was dead by then.  This is an excellent photo, even if it is staged.  He is wearing a catcher's mitt, but he was a second baseman.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_Schaefer\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_Schaefer</a>", "authorname": "budderflyman", "id": "8602872-3491625708-72157617561041870", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3491625708/#comment72157617645284701", "realname": "Josh Gerber", "path_alias": "theweekendwarrior", "author": "51701199@N00", "iconserver": "104", "datecreate": "1241538865", "_content": "he also successfully stole first base", "authorname": "JGerbs38", "id": "8602872-3491625708-72157617645284701", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3491625708/#comment72157617676541193", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "35239250@N07", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1241590207", "_content": "I love this photo. I like how he appears to be floating in the air, ready to catch the ball with this determined look on his face. I am not a big baseball fan so I searched his name to find a little more information about this baseball player.
