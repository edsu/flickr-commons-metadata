His father, a gardener by occupation, was an amateur violinist. He taught his two sons the violin and after discovering Jan's talent, who was aged five at the time, arranged for him to study with Karel Weber and Darel Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek. Aged eight he studied at the Prague Conservatory with Otakar \u0160ev\u010d\u00edk, of whose technique he became the most famous representative. As a child, he used to practice 10 to 12 hours a day, or &quot;until my fingers started to bleed.&quot; After 1898, he toured as a soloist, soon becoming renowned for his great virtuosity and flawless intonation, and his very full and noble tone. He played a Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 and also two Stradivarius violins: he acquired the 1715 Stradivarius Emperor in 1910.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Kubelik\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Kubelik</a>\n\nSomehow he doesn't look like a violinist to me.
