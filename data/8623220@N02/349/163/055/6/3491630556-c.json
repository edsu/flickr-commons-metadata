She is the sort of girl that never 'lolls.' She can run her own automobile, and does when she is at home and she loves athletics and anything that has excitement in it. She is a petite young person, with black hair and blue eyes and rosy cheeks and she speaks with an expression that suggests a bit of Irish brogue.\u201d\n\nVirginia married Thomas V. Brennan, an executive of the Independence Packing company in Chicago in 1918, and she died in 1937 at the age of 40. \n\nBoetius Sullivan and Loretta Connery were married December 27, 1911. <i>&ndash;Compiled and excerpted [<a href=\"http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mckinley/sullivan_sisters.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>] [<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9902E1DC1E31E03ABC4D52DFB266838B639EDE\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a>] [<a href=\"http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mckinley/weddings.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">4</a>]\n</i>", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-3491630556-72157617561231062", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3491630556/#comment72157617564812098", "realname": "Giulia Bartra", "path_alias": "giuliasphotography", "author": "10710862@N06", "iconserver": "8062", "datecreate": "1241208194", "_content": "wow this is so beautiful", "authorname": "Giulia Bartra", "id": "8602872-3491630556-72157617564812098", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3491630556/#comment72157617485627927", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mooncrying", "author": "26344568@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1241232143", "_content": "Marvelous Pic", "authorname": "~Actions By Michelle Nicole~", "id": "8602872-3491630556-72157617485627927", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3491630556/#comment72157617562270515", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "38013396@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1241380221", "_content": "I really like this picture!

She commented on woman's suffrage on  the Front Page June 24, 1908 saying, &quot;I think they do more harm then good. I know you have suffrage in Colorado, and I have often wondered how the women here found time to do anything in politics.&quot; Her husband, Roger Sullivan was a Chicago Politician. Even though Mrs. Roger Sullivan has made these comments, I think she might have played a bigger role than she may have thought. I would imagine that as a wife she would have had to throw dinners and attend important events. She must have had to keep a certain reputation or else risk her husband's political standing. For instance in Sarah Palin's case her family was constantly a subject that appeared in the media and might have contributed to her losing the race with McCain.

Sullivan) with daughter Virginia to left and d-i-l Loretta to right was probably taken about 1 July 1912 at the Dem Nat'l Conv. held in Baltimore which nominated Woodrow Wilson.\nI agree with posters who say she was not a shrinking violet; her opinions developed as her experience grew and situations changed.  Here's some more press on her (her comments posted above were when she accompanied her husband with their 5 children and guests to the 1908 Nat'l Dem Conv. in Denver):  From Belleville News Democrat 1914.10.21 - Roger Charles Sullivan \u201cwas the first practical sociologist of his time, sort of a crude Hull House on legs.\u201d ** \u201cNo sketch of Sullivan would be complete that did not include a reference to his family life.  He loves his home and spends much time in it.  Mrs. Sullivan is a woman of very impressive appearance, tall (5\u20199\u201d), with strong, regular features, and large dark eyes, contrasting with a high forehead and masses of nearly white hair.  She takes considerable interest in her husband\u2019s political career, and is herself a director in both the Democratic Woman\u2019s league and the Civil Service Reform club.\u201d \nChgo Trib, 2 Sep 1913 - Mrs. Roger Sullivan Decries Militancy -  Militancy will never win votes for the women of England. ** These are the observations of Mrs. Roger C. Sullivan, who with her daughter, Virginia, returned yesterday from a tour of European countries.  While awaiting her husband, who is expected today, Mrs. Sullivan and Miss Virginia are stopping at her son's home. ** &quot;English women are pursuing the wrong method in seeking the vote,&quot; said Mrs. Sullivan.  &quot;Why, at a meeting in Trafalgar square, London, I heard the speaker invite women present to join her in a bombardment.  The speeches were of the firebrand order and did not appeal to me.  **  &quot;American women are winning the ballot because they merely are asking for it, after assuming it is their right.  In other words, they are using brains instead of coercion, as witness the recent history in Illinois.  In this respect we resemble the French woman, her husband's partner in everything.  They assert their equality and the men of France accept it without complaint.&quot;", "authorname": "rathlin1", "id": "8602872-3491630556-72157618921717491", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3491630556/#comment72157622941522072", "realname": "Jaymi Morrow", "path_alias": "enyeart36", "author": "45299337@N02", "iconserver": "2535", "datecreate": "1260036864", "_content": "I am researching the Sullivan family genealogy.
