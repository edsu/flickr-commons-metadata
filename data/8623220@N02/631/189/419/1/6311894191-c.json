E. Liu, who contracted with Pratt and Whitney to produce prototypes of his rifle design in Connecticut.  The &quot;Liu Rifle&quot; is a rarity because much of the initial shipment was lost at sea, and it was never put into production in China.

A fascinating story.  Can anyone read the date? Do you think it's Sept. 1914 when Gen. Liu visited the U.S.?  Interesting, too, that he is posed with a sword.  Thanks so much for your research.
