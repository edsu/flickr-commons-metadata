He was &quot;DuPage County Judge before the turn of the century, when it was considered a public service that prominent lawyers accepted. Mr. Gary was elected to a first term in 1884 and served a second term from 1888 until 1892. Curiously, for the remainder of his long life, he was always addressed as 'Judge Gary' even by his friend, President Theodore Roosevelt, and other national leaders.&quot; He was a principal in United States Steel Corporation when it was founded in 1901.  &quot;Judge&quot; Gary remained the chief executive officer of the United States Steel Corporation until the day of his death more than twenty-six years later.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-6311900581-72157628051623558", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6311900581/#comment72157628052665762", "realname": "", "path_alias": "melystu", "author": "92033577@N00", "iconserver": "7439", "datecreate": "1320431532", "_content": "Quite the man!

He was a key founder of U.S. Steel in 1901, bringing together partners J. P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, and Charles M. Schwab. The city of Gary, Indiana, a steel town, was named for him when it was founded in 1906. When trust busting President Theodore Roosevelt said that Gary was head of the steel trust, Gary considered it a compliment. The two men communicated in a non-confrontational way unlike Roosevelt's relationship with leaders of other trusts.\n\nSource: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbert_Henry_Gary\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbert_Henry_Gary</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-6311900581-72157628058866910", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6311900581/#comment72157627935290061", "realname": "Angela Orlando", "path_alias": "maorlando", "author": "16489083@N05", "iconserver": "7428", "datecreate": "1320522013", "_content": "Great portrait and great info from others... thanks!!!\nA link to a song to go with it: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ILt3wNTZ7Q\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ILt3wNTZ7Q</a>", "authorname": "maorlando God kept us 2012 leaning on Him 2013", "id": "8602872-6311900581-72157627935290061", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6311900581/#comment72157627966423761", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1320864013", "_content": "Thank you swanq and Richard Arthur Norton for providing background information on Elbert Gary.
