He was accused of being the middleman in a case where one railroad had been ordered to divest its holdings in another.  Being a wealthy coal merchant, but without a background in railroading, he claimed he offered to buy the holdings, which he did, then re-sold them to an affiliate of the seller for a $2.7 Million profit.\n\nActually, Charles S. Mellen, the selling party for the Boston Maine Railroad, helped finance this collusive sale as a conspiratorial transaction to later re-acquire the divested shares.  Both men were indicted by the government and subjected to a civil suit for restitution of the money gained in the transaction. \n\nOne of the many stories on the scandal:\n\n&quot;NEW HAVEN SUES BILLARD TO GET $3,828,147 BACK; Mellen and Five Others Also Defendants in Action Over Boston &amp; Maine Sale.
