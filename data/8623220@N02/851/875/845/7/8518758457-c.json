It is among the earliest and most elaborate of a chain of coastal forts, which also includes Calshot, Camber,Walmer and Pendennis Castles. Most were built at great speed between 1539 and 1542 by order of King Henry VIII, who feared an invasion by the Catholic powers of Europe. Its squat, rounded turrets were designed to deflect incoming cannon balls, and acted as platforms from which to fire barrages from increasingly sophisticated artillery pieces.\nThe fort guarded the sheltered anchorage of \u2018the Downs\u2019 \u2013 the stretch of water between the shore and the hazardous Goodwin Sands, a graveyard of ships. Today you can explore the whole of the castle from the storerooms to the first-floor captain\u2019s residence. A pleasant cycle path links Deal and Walmer Castles along the beachfront.&quot;\nFrom <a href=\"http://wikimapia.org/3792644/Deal-Castle-Kent\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikimapia.org/3792644/Deal-Castle-Kent</a>\n\nSee also \n  <a href=\"http://johnsmilitaryhistory.com/deal.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">johnsmilitaryhistory.com/deal.html</a>\nfor photos outside and in.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-8518758457-72157632890400453", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8518758457/#comment72157632894672552", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1362192663", "_content": "Street view  <a href=\"http://goo.gl/maps/fuyJy\" rel=\"nofollow\">goo.gl/maps/fuyJy</a>", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-8518758457-72157632894672552", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "8518758457"}}
