She was the fifth child and second daughter of George I of Greece and Olga Konstantinovna of Russia and as such,  a family member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg.\n\n&quot;On April 30, 1900, Maria was married to Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia in Corfu. George chased after Maria, who was nicknamed &quot;Greek Minny&quot; to tell her apart from the Dowager Empress Maria of Russia. She refused to marry unless her place in the line of succession to the Greek and Danish thrones was secured. She made it clear that she was not in love with him when she married him, but the Grand Duke hoped that feelings might grow in time. \n\n&quot;The couple had two daughters:Nina, born June 7, 1901, and Xenia, born  August 9, 1903. As they grew older, Maria seized the opportunity to spend more time abroad, ostensibly for her daughters' health, but also to spend more time away from her husband. She was in Great Britain when World War I broke out and chose not return to Russia&quot; [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Maria_of_Greece_and_Denmark\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>] &nbsp; There are several photographs of The Grand Duke in the <i>LOC Bain Collection</i> on Flickr, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/tags/granddukealexandermikhailovich/\">here</a>.\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-6399917937-72157628207832137", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6399917937/#comment72157628227964085", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1322706807", "_content": "This forum has some more pictures of her:\n  <a href=\"http://forum.alexanderpalace.org/index.php?topic=3936.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">forum.alexanderpalace.org/index.php?topic=3936.0</a>\nand here's another:\n  <a href=\"http://www.librarything.com/author/georgegrandduchessof\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.librarything.com/author/georgegrandduchessof</a>", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-6399917937-72157628227964085", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6399917937/#comment72157628237903511", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1322772228", "_content": "I don't think it is a spelling variant, as I haven't seen it except in connection with this photo.\nI believe &quot;Georgievna&quot; is a patronimic, indicating she is the daughter of George.", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6399917937-72157628237903511", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6399917937"}}
