Here is an excerpt:\n\n&quot;Alcyone, Beautiful Persian, Shows\nHe Can Do More than Win\nBlue Ribbons.\n- \u2022 \u2022 -\nOWNER IS PARALYZED\nAND WAITING FOR DEATH\n-\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022-\nFinds Amusement, Relaxation\nand Comfort in Antics and\nLoyalty of Pet \nNestling upon the lap of his atrophied patient, amusing the ill man with his antics at play, or running to call the mistress of the household when her presence is needed, Alcyone, John.
