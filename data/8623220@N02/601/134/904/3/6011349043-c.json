XV, Italian: Benedetto XV; 21 November 1854 \u2013 22 January 1922), born <b>Giacomo Paolo Giovanni Battista della Chiesa</b>, reigned as Pope from 3 September 1914 to 22 January 1922. His pontificate was largely overshadowed by World War I and its political, social and humanitarian consequences in Europe.\nBetween 1846 and 1903, the Church experienced its two longest pontificates in history, up to that point. Together Pius IX and Leo XIII ruled for 57 years. In 1914, the Cardinals choose Della Chiesa at the age of 59, indicating their desire for another long-lasting pontificate at the outbreak of World War I, which he labeled \u201cthe suicide of civilized Europe.\u201d The war and its consequences were the main focus of Benedict. He declared the neutrality of the Holy See and attempted from that perspective to mediate peace in 1916 and 1917. Both sides rejected his initiatives. German Protestants rejected any \u201cPapal Peace\u201d as insulting. French politician Georges Clemenceau regarded the Vatican initiative as anti-French.\n\n[The current] Pope Benedict XVI showed his own admiration for Benedict XV following his election to the Papacy on 19 April 2005.", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-6011349043-72157627238933765", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011349043/#comment72157627378540444", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1312743371", "_content": "LOC -- there is a misspelling in your title -- should be &quot;della&quot; not &quot;Delia&quot;.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-6011349043-72157627378540444", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011349043/#comment72157627378626504", "realname": "d francis", "path_alias": "foreversalongtime", "author": "35923635@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1312744075", "_content": "Evil.", "authorname": "forever's a long time", "id": "8602872-6011349043-72157627378626504", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011349043/#comment72157627272033325", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1312924051", "_content": "Thanks trialsanderrors for the brief biography and link, and thanks Wystan for noting the misspelling.
