Hamburg (German Passenger Liner, 1899).\nLater named Red Cross, Hudson and President Fillmore\n\nUSS Powhatan, a 18,026-ton troop transport, was originally the German passenger steamer Hamburg, which had been built in 1899 at Stettin, Germany. Caught at New York when World War I began in August 1914, she was soon chartered by the American Red Cross to take medical personnel and supplies to Europe. Renamed Red Cross, she left New York in mid-September and called at Falmouth, England; Paulliac, France; and Rotterdam, The Netherlands, before recrossing the Atlantic in October with American refugees on board. She remained at New York for the next two and a half years.\n\nAlso <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Powhatan_(ID-3013)\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Powhatan_(ID-3013)</a>\n\nOn the &quot;Red Cross&quot;:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011905580/in/photostream]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011905410/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-6011354601-72157627362892082", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011354601/#comment72157627285823173", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1313084104", "_content": "Thanks trialsanderrors for providing the link to more information about this ship.
