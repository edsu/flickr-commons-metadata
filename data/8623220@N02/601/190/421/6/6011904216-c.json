Born in Pontypridd, Wales, and christened Frederick Hall Thomas, he was nicknamed the &quot;Welsh Wizard&quot;. Brought up in a tough mining community, Welsh left a middle-class background to make a name for himself in America. He turned professional as a boxer in Philadelphia in 1905, and spent the best part of his career fighting in the United States, leaving many in Britain to incorrectly believe he was an exponent of an ungentlemanly style of American boxing.\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011354245/in/photostream][http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011904366/in/photostream][http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011353771/in/photostream][http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011353619/in/photostream][http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011903738/in/photostream][http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011903162/in/photostream][http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011903412/in/photostream]\nand...\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011353299/in/photostream]", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-6011904216-72157627362982790", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "6011904216"}}
