In the Miraflores locks, vessels are lifted (or lowered) in three stages totalling 8 m, allowing them to transit to or from the Pacific Ocean port of Balboa (near Panama City). Ships cross below the Puente de las Am\u00e9ricas (Bridge of the Americas) which connects North and South America.\n\nNewsworthy because the Panama Canal was opened on 15 August 1914.\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011348077/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-6011899050-72157627238938985", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011899050/#comment72157627363526002", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "29079609@N02", "iconserver": "5491", "datecreate": "1312566819", "_content": "SS Santa Clara, a single-screw, steel-hulled freighter built during 1913 by William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship and Engine Building Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was chartered by the United States Army on 28 October 1917 for voyages to the European war zone and given a Naval Armed Guard.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Santa_Clara_(ID-4523)\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Santa_Clara_(ID-4523)</a>", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-6011899050-72157627363526002", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011899050/#comment72157627279175131", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "61415649@N04", "iconserver": "3718", "datecreate": "1313004791", "_content": "this is vintage old canal! mrdot.", "authorname": "mrdot.", "id": "8602872-6011899050-72157627279175131", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6011899050"}}
