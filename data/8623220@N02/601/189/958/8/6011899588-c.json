It is the principal city of the Lille M\u00e9tropole, the fourth-largest metropolitan area in the country behind those of Paris, Lyon and Marseille. Lille is situated on the De\u00fble River, near France's border with Belgium. It is the capital of the Nord-Pas de Calais region and the prefecture of the Nord department.\n\nBetween 4\u201313 October 1914, the troops in Lille were able to trick the enemy by convincing them that Lille possessed more artillery than was the case; in reality, the city had only a single cannon. Despite the deception, the German bombardments destroyed over 2,200 buildings and homes. When the Germans realised they had been tricked, they burned down an entire section of town, subsequently occupying the city. Lille was liberated by the British on 17 October 1918, when General Sir William Birdwood and his troops were welcomed by joyous crowds. The general was made an honorary citizen of the city of Lille on 28 October of that year.", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-6011899588-72157627363274650", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011899588/#comment72157627379055256", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1312747521", "_content": "Lille in ruins, 1916:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/9956525@N05/5715221657/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-6011899588-72157627379055256", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6011899588/#comment72157627411302504", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1313096453", "_content": "Thanks trialsanderrors for providing the Wikipedia link; we'll fill in the caption information the next time we update.
