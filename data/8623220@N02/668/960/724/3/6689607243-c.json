I tried to figure out who the other men are. The one on the right looks to be an admiral, and the one on the left is wearing medals and holding a naval-esque hat. I though maybe the man on the right is Admiral Hokojiro Ijichi, but this man seems a bit too old. I also saw a photo of Admiral Tomioka (I believe he was the grandfather of Admiral Sadatoshi Tomioki of WWII) but I could only find one photo and I wasn't convinced.
