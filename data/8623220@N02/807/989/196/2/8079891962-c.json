Apparently her bedroom was copied from a Renaissance painting of St. Ursula (there's also a 1921 photo of her at this link):\n<a href=\"http://aestheteslament.blogspot.com/2011_09_28_archive.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">aestheteslament.blogspot.com/2011_09_28_archive.html</a>\nHer mother was Anne Harriman Sands Rutherfurd Vanderbilt.  Her stepfather was William K. Vanderbilt Sr.  (whose ex-wife Alva is also in this week's uploads).  Barbara married twice--to Cyril Hatch in 1916 (divorced 1921), and to Winfield J. Nicholls in 1924 (divorced 1927, and in Reno 1930).    She (and her mother and sister) were involved in a cult called &quot;the Mystic Order of Tantricks,&quot; run by someone called &quot;Oom the Omnipotent.&quot;  Her children, twins, were born five months into her second marriage; she was apparently not involved in their upbringing (or even in choosing their names).  Her second husband claimed she was a lunatic and sought to have their marriage annulled.  Barbara died at age 44, at Cannes, France.\n<a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=60ZQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CQ4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4754%2C1799284\" rel=\"nofollow\">news.google.com/newspapers?id=60ZQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CQ4EA...</a>\n\nHer brother Winthrop Rutherfurd married (as his second wife) Lucy Page Mercer--the mistress of FDR.
