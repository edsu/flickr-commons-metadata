Fery-Bognar who fought in the Austro-Hungarian army as a volunteer, was promoted to the rank of corporal in 1916, and for her valorous deeds was presented by the Emperor Franz Josef with a brooch decorated with his name. The first and only woman who won the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Franz_Joseph\" rel=\"nofollow\">Order of Franz Josef</a> in Austria-Hungary was the wife of the district commander of Lublin, Lieutenant v. Turnau. She was no soldier but through her personal bravery and her heroic deportment in the Carpathians stayed the flight of a receding division and heartened them anew to further combat. There were a considerable number of women in the Austrian army who served as volunteers in the Ukraine.\n</blockquote>", "authorname": "pbhome", "id": "8602872-8079898722-72157631752803953", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8079898722/#comment72157631766911777", "realname": "Zinaida Beaumont", "path_alias": null, "author": "37408767@N03", "iconserver": "3494", "datecreate": "1350225843", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pbhome] Thank you\nA rare woman indeed", "authorname": "Zinaida Beaumont (very busy)", "id": "8602872-8079898722-72157631766911777", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8079898722/#comment72157631785484399", "realname": "Arden", "path_alias": "arden_loc", "author": "35072786@N08", "iconserver": "3331", "datecreate": "1350413907", "_content": "pbhome:\n\nThank you for the fascinating story of Fraiilein Marie von Fery-Bognar, volunteer in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I.
