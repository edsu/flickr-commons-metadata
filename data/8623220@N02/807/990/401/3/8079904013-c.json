There are two similar Greeley statues.  For some reason they accurately describe the one pictured above as in City Hall Park, but they picture it on the Greeley Park page of their site.\nOn the City Hall Park page, they accurately describe the statue there (pictured above in the Bain photo) but they mistakenly picture the Greeley Square statue.\n<a href=\"http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/cityhallpark/highlights/13314\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nycgovparks.org/parks/cityhallpark/highlights/13314</a>\nThe most obvious difference is that Greeley has a newspaper spread out on his right thigh in the City Hall Park statue, and has a book hanging down in his right hand in the Greeley Square one.\n<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=greeley+square,+new+york&amp;ll=40.748465,-73.988176&amp;spn=0.000001,0.000889&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hnear=Greeley+Square,+72+W+36th+St,+New+York,+10018&amp;gl=us&amp;t=h&amp;z=21&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.748465,-73.988176&amp;panoid=r85OBtoXTTOHYiuldSesoQ&amp;cbp=12,306.85,,2,1.94\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com/maps?q=greeley+square,+new+york&amp;ll=40...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-8079904013-72157631759820643", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8079904013/#comment72157631759897443", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1350145825", "_content": "Then there's the question of why this photo is in the June, 1915 news stream.  On June 13, 1915, the N.Y. Times published a story about the building's owners wanting to rent the corner space to a drugstore, and needed to move the statue to do so. It's a wry, tongue in cheek story, which notes that after the shoeshine stand was installed to the left of Greeley, it looked like he was waiting in line for a shine.  The statue moved across the street into the park eventually, but the place was not determined when the article was written.  It was suggested, though, that, the statue (in the famous words of Greeley)  &quot;go west ,young man&quot;, and it did.\n<a href=\"http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D13FF3D5512738FDDAA0994DE405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D13FF3D551273...</a>\n\nAlso dating the picture are the news headlines above the statue.  It looks like they had someone up there on a wooden platform painting them for the passersby.  These headlines, about the Wilson diplomatic note  that caused his Secretary of State to resign, the turmoil in Mexico, and the Italian offensive on Trento (Trent) are all stories in  the Tribune's edition of June 11, 1915:\n<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1915-06-11/ed-1/seq-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1915-06-11/ed-...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-8079904013-72157631759897443", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8079904013/#comment72157631785216831", "realname": "Arden", "path_alias": "arden_loc", "author": "35072786@N08", "iconserver": "3331", "datecreate": "1350411533", "_content": "artolog--\n\nThank you for tracking down the additional details about the Greeley statues and for alerting us to the mix up in the photos on the NYC parks website.
