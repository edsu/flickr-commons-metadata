In return for $25,000, he agreed to keep other film companies from his battlefield, to fight in daylight whenever possible, and to reconstruct battles if the footage needed reshooting. \n\n&quot;Now the subject of an HBO film starring Antonio Banderas (And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself), Villa is one of the main protagonists in Margarita de Orellana's vivid account of the American movie industry's fascination with the events of the Mexican Revolution. \n\n&quot;Through memoir accounts, newspaper reports, and analysis of the films themselves, &quot;Filming Pancho&quot; reveals much about how Mexico was constructed in the American imagination and how the film images reinforced and justified American expansionism and racial and social prejudices.&quot;\n\n--From a description, on Amazon, of a documentary movie of Hollywood's treatment of the Mexican Revolution.

About your comment on why we don't correct  the exposure of this image--at least three concerns hold us back from editing images. \n\nAuthenticity: Digitizing a photograph as it has survived through time reassures viewers that we're representing the original artifact faithfully. Editing an image undermines the reliability of the photo as a historical document. Once we start changing the tonal contrast of the image, who's to know how much other image content we changed.\n \nSubjective choices: Different users have different preferences when it comes to pumping up contrast, sharpening edges, cropping negative borders, etc.  Offering the basic image allows users make their own decisions about which features to change to suit a particular purpose or product.\n\nLack of money and time: If we had more resources, offering a 'cleaned up photo' in addition to the 'raw document' could be considered.  (Like pre-conservation and post-conservation images of a damaged and then repaired poster.)
