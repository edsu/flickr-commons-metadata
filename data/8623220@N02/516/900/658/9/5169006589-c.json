Not wishing to be on the same team as the swaggering Oldfield he quit on the spot. Oldfield was well pleased until he found out that DePalma had announced that he would MODIFY HIS OLD MERCEDES and enter as a private individual. [Emphasis added.]\n\n&quot;Playing a waiting game he watched as the leading cars including Oldfield wore out their tires. Ten laps from the end he saw his chance and sprinted into the lead. In front of him was Oldfield but as soon as he passed his rival he made signals to his pit that he was coming in. Seeing this Oldfield decided to make a pitstop also to replace worn tires. As Oldfield\u2019s Mercer was having his tires replaced he glanced onto the track just as DePalma was driving by. It dawned on Oldfield in a second, he had been tricked, DePalma never planned to stop. In a rage the Mercer leapt out of the pits. Oldfield, for all his braggadocio was not without talent or courage. For the last 6 laps he gave everything that he had to close the gap but fell 200 yards short as DePalma took the flag.&quot;", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5169006589-72157625275730857", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5169006589/#comment72157625396728810", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1289873671", "_content": "The photo shows DePalma at the time of winning of the 200-mile 1914 Vanderbilt Cup race, which followed an eight-mile course over the public roads of Santa Monica, California.
