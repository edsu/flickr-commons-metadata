HBL attended public school in Albany, and earned both Bachelor (1895) and Master (1896) of Pedagogy degrees from Albany Normal College. After graduation she moved to New York City, taught in the public schools, and in 1902 earned degrees from Barnard College (A.B.) and Illinois Wesleyan University (Ph.B.). During this time she also took summer courses at Harvard (1900), the University of Chicago (1901), and Oxford University (1903). She continued to teach and started graduate school at Columbia University, but stopped both when she married James Lees Laidlaw in 1905. A concern with women's rights now blossomed into a remarkably active involvement in a variety of causes and organizations.&quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-5169003915-72157625252410277", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5169003915/#comment72157625375704126", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1289675922", "_content": "Other Bain/LOC photos of New York women involved in suffrage day activities on May 2, 1914:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5415574013/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5416186200/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5169003101/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5169602482/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5169003211/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5169603438/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5169604500/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5416183608/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5169003915-72157625375704126", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5169003915/#comment72157625257375723", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1289676191", "_content": "Stories of Suffrage Day events in The New York Times, May 3, 1914:\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F50D1EF9355D13738DDDAA0894DD405B848DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F50D1EF9355D13...</a>", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5169003915-72157625257375723", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5169003915/#comment72157625411048562", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1290026109", "_content": "Thank you Swang for the information on Mrs. Laidlaw.
