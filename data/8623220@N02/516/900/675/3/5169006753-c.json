His start that year was lackluster, so he was banished to the Philadelphia team, where he didn't do much better. Early in 1914, he grabbed a chance to return to Pittsburgh by joining a new team, the Pittsburgh Rebels -- one of eight teams in the newly-formed Federal League (whose existence was brief). The report of his leap to the Federals likely was the news event that impelled the Bain News Agency to circulate this photo of Camnitz to its subscribers. Camnitz continued with the Rebels in 1915, but retired from baseball in that year, because of problems with his pitching arm.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5169006753-72157625413838504", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5169006753"}}
