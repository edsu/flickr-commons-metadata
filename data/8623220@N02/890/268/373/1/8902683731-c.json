A joint British and French operation was mounted to capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople (Istanbul) and secure a sea route to Russia.[6] Following an unsuccessful naval campaign to force a passage through the Dardanelles, an amphibious landing was undertaken on the Gallipoli peninsula. The attempt failed after eight months of heavy fighting and many casualties on both sides; the force was finally evacuated. The campaign was one of the greatest victories of the Ottomans during the war and is considered a major failure by the Allies.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Campaign\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Campaign</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-8902683731-72157633890318676", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8902683731/#comment72157633905106287", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anne_loc", "author": "35014516@N03", "iconserver": "3087", "datecreate": "1370282416", "_content": "artolog:  Thanks for finding details on this campaign.
