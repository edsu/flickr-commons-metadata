Looks like Bain screwed up.  Hamilton Fish's All-Stars, a team of former , mostly Ivy League, football stars played Rutgers' 1915 team at the Polo Grounds 11/13/15. So this team is either one or the other of those two.  I think they look older than 22, so I will say All-Stars, but that's pretty subjective.  Hamilton Fish, pictured separately, played for his team that day.
