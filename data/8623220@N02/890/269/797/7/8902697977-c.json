However, all the circumstantial evidence (its placement in a series of pictures of college activities and people closely connected with the Institute at the time of Booker T. Washington's death,  the racial makeup of the nurses and patients, etc.) marks it as almost unmistakably taken in the Institute's hospital.  This was John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital,  which claimed to be the first full-service hospital for the treatment of Black patients.  Perhaps more importantly, due to racial discrimination, it was one of the few places in the Jim Crow South where Black doctors and medical professionals could work.  It was opened in February, 1913.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2641895/?page=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2641895/?page=3</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2410\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2410</a>\n\nAlso, Tuskegee was and is a very small place (even today, with a university, there are only 11,000 people.
