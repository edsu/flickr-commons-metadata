On the Internet, the error seems confined primarily to English and French language web sites. Sites in Spanish almost all spell his surname Bielovucic (and call him Juan rather than Jean.)  Though born in Peru, he was of Croatian and French ancestry, and appears to have spent much of his adult life in France. \n\nThe English language web site Early Aviators <a href=\"http://earlyaviators.com/ebielovu.htm\">gets his name right</a>, though. Click on the thumbnail of the 1911 &quot;Circuit Europeen&quot; card on that page and then scroll down to see Bielovucic's plane of that time, with an inset of him wearing what might be the same checkered cap he sports in this Bain photo. The plane in the Bain photo appears to be more modern, though, and might be the monoplane in which he crossed the Alps in January, 1913. Caps apparently outlasted aircraft in those days.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-3065191451-72157610334229733", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3065191451/#comment72157610457127737", "realname": "Tanongsak Ingwattanapoka", "path_alias": "temsippbangkok", "author": "14182180@N05", "iconserver": "7047", "datecreate": "1228064404", "_content": "nice", "authorname": "temsippbangkok", "id": "8602872-3065191451-72157610457127737", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3065191451/#comment72157610690070364", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1228334363", "_content": "logista &amp; whyaduck:  Thanks for providing leads to Bielovucic's correct name form.
