Some of those include the fencing and seating along the backstop, the cement dividers of the box seats, the three parallel wood runners that line the backwall of the dugouts, the arrangement of the columns holding up the upper deck, the advertisements along the outfield wall, and, after the fire, the unique facing on the outside of the ballpark's second deck.  \n\nYou will also note that a number of the baseball photos in the Bain photostream were taken at the Yankees' former home field at Hilltop Park, and (then new) Ebbets Field.  This is largely due to George Grantham Bain, and the Bain offices themselves, being based in New York City.  Also, in 1914, both the New York Yankees and New York Giants played at the Polo Grounds.  This is another reason why there are photos of American League and National League visiting teams and players at the ballpark.", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "8602872-6152488337-72157627789093864", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6152488337/#comment72157627911608532", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1318821744", "_content": "I see, thanks.", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6152488337-72157627911608532", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6152488337"}}
