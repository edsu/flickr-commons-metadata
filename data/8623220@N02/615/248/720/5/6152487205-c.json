It was indeed used for radio transmitting (higher = farther range to send and receive)  When it was clear the German High Seas Fleet would remain in the North Sea only, most British ships struck the top mast. The medium level masts and yard arms were primarily used for signal flags.  In the Battles of Jutland and Dogger Bank, British problems with using and seeing flag signals played an important part in the Germans not being heavily defeated both times.  At Jutland, 4 of the strongest battleships in the world were left 5 miles behind the battle against the German battle cruisers because of the way the flags were handled. In the directly ensuing battle, 2 British battle cruisers were sunk.   At Dogger Bank, a poorly worded signal caused the heavy British ships to all attack already lost Blucher instead of pursuing the other German  sips.", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-6152487205-72157627614503891", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "6152487205"}}
