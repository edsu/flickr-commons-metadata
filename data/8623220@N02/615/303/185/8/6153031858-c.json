She was too slow to out run them, and too lightly armed/gunned to fight them. The decision to include her in the line meant the end of her at the battle of Dogger Bank.  A misunderstood British signal led to her destruction by overwhelming forces while allowing the rest of the German battle cruiser squadron to escape. She fought bravely until the very end, earning the admiration of the British.  The loss of Blucher and severe damage to Seydlitz was to have long term consequences for the German fleet because of the Kaiser's reaction.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Bl%C3%BCcher\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Bl%C3%BCcher</a>", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-6153031858-72157627683085428", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "6153031858"}}
