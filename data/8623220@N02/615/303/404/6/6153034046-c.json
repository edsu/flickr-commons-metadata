The title was later used by lancer regiments in the Russian, Prussian, and Austrian armies.\nUhlans typically wore a double-breasted jacket (kurta) with a coloured panel (plastron) at the front, a coloured sash, and a square-topped Polish lancer cap (czapka) also spelt 'chapka,' chapska and schapska. This cap or cavalry helmet was derived from a traditional design of Polish cap, made more formal and stylised for military use.\nTheir lances usually had small, swallow-tailed flags (known as the lance pennon) just below the spearhead.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uhlan\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uhlan</a>\n\nOn Guelzin I find Le Port Ecluse Guelzin, which leads me to Cond\u00e9-sur-l'Escaut:\n\nCond\u00e9-sur-l'Escaut is a commune of the Nord department in northern France.
