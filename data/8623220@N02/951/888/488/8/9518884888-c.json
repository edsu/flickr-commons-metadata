Since 1986, a diesel-hydraulic railway has run the length of the pier, replacing the electric service which opened in 1890. The pier has been beset by fires; a fire in 1995 destroyed the bowling alley at the start of the pier and another fire in October 2005 damaged the far end of the pier. The pier was also run through by a boat in 1984.&quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-9518884888-72157635181742324", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9518884888/#comment72157635184722567", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66311327@N05", "iconserver": "7333", "datecreate": "1377199778", "_content": "Streetview: <a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?q=loc:51.53789,0.71377&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.5337,0.715334&amp;spn=0.00292,0.008256&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=51.533733,0.715233&amp;panoid=Fo-_Gy3hj0A-RZQbcT4qVA&amp;cbp=12,158.86,,0,-4.85\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com/maps?q=loc:51.53789,0.71377&amp;hl=en&amp...</a>", "authorname": "B-59", "id": "8602872-9518884888-72157635184722567", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9518884888/#comment72157635245470486", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1377532734", "_content": "Thank you for your research swanq.
