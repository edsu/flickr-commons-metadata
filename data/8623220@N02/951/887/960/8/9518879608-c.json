And significantly, the clock tower is now visible at the end of the road.\nThe clock tower was built in 1898 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897.

The clock tower is the most noticeable difference by far, but it also looks to me as if the trees lining the street are more filled in in this image. Do you think that the flag poles were installed for the Diamond Jubilee?  We'll fill in some of the information you've provided the next time we update the records.", "authorname": "Ryan (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-9518879608-72157635245332712", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9518879608/#comment72157635265219937", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "31580040@N04", "iconserver": "3187", "datecreate": "1377688603", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryan_loc]  I have no evidence but that is likely, re. the flagpoles.  I agree that the trees have put growth on between the dates of the photos, but probably only a couple of years.\n\nIf I've got the link right, <a href=\"https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;tab=wl\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;tab=wl</a> is the Streetview of the junction as it is today.
