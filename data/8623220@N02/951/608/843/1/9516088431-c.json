The flag poles are not on the buildings.  And significantly, the clock tower is not visible at the end of the road.\n\nThe clock tower was built in 1898 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897.  Its absence in this picture and presence in the previous shot shows that this photo was taken earlier.", "authorname": "Retired at last", "id": "8602872-9516088431-72157635200194628", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9516088431/#comment72157635245360790", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1377532242", "_content": "Thanks for your excellent detective work, Retired at last. The clock tower is the most noticeable difference by far between the two images. Do you think that the flag poles were installed for the Diamond Jubilee?
