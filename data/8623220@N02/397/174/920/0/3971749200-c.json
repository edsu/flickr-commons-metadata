The Babe ran into the pavilion parapet with the full force of his body, and dropped unconscious to the grass. Uniformed policemen ran to his assistance and kept back the crowd that seemed disposed to leave the chairs and get a close-up of the injured warrior. Several photographers happened to be on the spot and snapped the Babe as Trainer Doc Woods ran up with the water bucket and the little black bag of first aid preparations.\n    At first it was thought that Ruth had been knocked out by a blow from the concrete on his chin, but it was soon discovered that he had been knocked out by a jolt in the solar plexus. His left leg was also hurt at the hip.\n    [Yankee manager Miller] Huggins wanted Ruth to quit, but he insisted upon staying in, and got a double in the sixth\u2026", "authorname": "jcassara73", "id": "8602872-3971749200-72157622412930225", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3971749200/#comment72157622766319544", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "43758249@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1257756366", "_content": "Visible just below the policeman's outstretched arm is Yankee center fielder Whitey Whitt,  leaning against the outfield wall.

After a torrid .400 BA start, Combes broke his ankle in June and Whitt was reinstated as the CF'er for the rest of the season.\n\nWhitey Whitt's real name was Ladislaw Waldemar Wittkowski.  Unlike most players of his day, Whitt was a college boy, having attended Bowdoin College.  He was also no stranger to the perils of playing the outfield.  Two seasons before the Babe's felling in Washington, Whitt himself was put down by a bottle thrown by a Browns' fan the day the Yankees clinched the 1922 pennant  in St. Louis.\n\nAfter initially offering a one thousand dollar reward for the fingering of the perpetrator, American League president Ban Johnson abruptly changed course when St. Louis fans threatened a riot.
