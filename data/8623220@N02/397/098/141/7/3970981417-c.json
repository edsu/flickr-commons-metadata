I think that may account for the pipe smoking and gun toting seen in this photo.\n\nThe Ball brothers also put down the cash to start Ball State University in Muncie.  Because their sister had been blackballed by an Ivy League sorority back east, one of their conditions of founding was that there be no national sororities affiliated with the campus, a policy which still stands.", "authorname": "thetallguy747", "id": "8602872-3970981417-72157627778894565", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3970981417/#comment72157633235793149", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "27549338@N05", "iconserver": "4105", "datecreate": "1365901194", "_content": "Photography, like anything, is about more than one thing.
