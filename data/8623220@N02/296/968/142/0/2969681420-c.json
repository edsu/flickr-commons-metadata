There's a photo of Stanislaus on <a href=\"http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/zbyszko.asp\">this page</a> at the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame.

There are quite a  few pictures of both brothers on the Internet, and they were remarkably similar, but most of the pictures identified as Stanislaus show a guy with a moustache, while those identified as Wladek show him without facial hair.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/w/wladek-zbyszko.php\">Some undated photos of Wladek here</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.polishsportshof.com/bios/Zbyszko_s.html\">Two undated photos of Stanley (Stanislaus) here</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.wrestling-titles.com/personalities/zbyszko_stanislaus/\">Photo of an older Stanislaus, sans moustache, here</a>.\n\nIt's puzzling, anyway.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-2969681420-72157608371440167", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2969681420/#comment72157608379411858", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11418107@N02", "iconserver": "1068", "datecreate": "1225031055", "_content": "I wonder if the crossed out word before &quot;Zbyszko&quot; on the original means that the first annotator also wasn't sure whether it was Wladek or Stanislaus!\n\nI'd agree it looks more like Stanislaus.
