Maurice Bennett Flynn, a Yale football player (fullback in the 1912 team) married a chorus girl in January 1913, and separated a few days later.  He was divorced by her 6 months later.  However, it appears that the damage to his Yale career was done; he was not allowed to return after his marriage to the chorus girl.  So presumably this photo was taken in late 1912, since his debut was in October 1912.\n\nIn the 1920s he became an actor in silent movies.  See <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0283555/\">www.imdb.com/name/nm0283555/</a>\n\nHe died in 1959 -- after several more marriages.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-2968833413-72157608436461045", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2968833413"}}
