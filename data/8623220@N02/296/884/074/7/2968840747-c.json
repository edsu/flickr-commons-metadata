It was broken up after 9 rounds by state police because Flynn, bloody and beaten, had given up any real tactics and was simply trying to launch into Johnson with headbutts.  Here's the <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9806E4D61F31E233A25756C0A9619C946396D6CF\">round-by-round from the New York Times</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F05EFDE113AE633A25750C2A9609C946396D6CF\">Another New York Times article</a> from just before the match writes it off as a gimmick match.  Flynn was aging and was never a world-class boxer.  Johnson was mentioned in the article as two years retired and fat, but he looks in good shape in contemporary photos, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Johnson_(boxer)\">continued fighting for more than fifteen years</a>.\n\n&quot;Flynn's Camp&quot; should be regarded as the training camp for the fight, not an actual camp name.  Flynn was a fireman in Pueblo, Co.\n\nA May 2, 1912 NYTimes article (&quot;$1,100 for Johnson's Training&quot;) says that Flynn's camp would be in Montezuma, NM.\n\nJack Curley was Jim's manager for the fight as well as the fight's promoter.\n\nNot sure on others in the photo.\n\n(by the way, Las Vegas, Nevada, our present-day boxing locus, was in 1912 a year-old city filled with dude ranches for guys wanting to get six weeks of residency for a legal divorce)", "authorname": "Rob Ketcherside", "id": "8602872-2968840747-72157608335381668", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2968840747/#comment72157608357262964", "realname": "Rob Ketcherside", "path_alias": "tigerzombie", "author": "29056926@N02", "iconserver": "3136", "datecreate": "1224960512", "_content": "This photo is a set with two others:  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2968841167/\">Johnson sparring</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2968840967\">Flynn posing as if sparring</a>.\n\nInscription on the photo indicates which name goes to which man.
