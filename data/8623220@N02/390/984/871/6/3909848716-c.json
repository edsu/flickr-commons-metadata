They reversed the captions for the Flood and Huntington houses, and also gave J.C. Flood the wrong middle initial. The Flood house has been altered since the fire, with additions at the sides and the removal of the low tower above the entrance on the California Street side (seen in this photo), but is still easily recognizable. The other side of the Flood house, facing Sacramento Street, can be seen on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3909849522/in/photostream/\">this Tribune page</a>, where it is misidentified as the Hopkins Art Institute.\n\nCollis P.
