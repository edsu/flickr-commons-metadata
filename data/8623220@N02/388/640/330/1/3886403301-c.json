When he began to protest, volubly, the gendarmes cautioned him: &quot;Don't make waves!&quot; So he sits now, stymied and disgusted, with his rolled-up rental sign in his lap -- thinking black thoughts, and hoping that a tired soul will notice him, and approach with an offer for the chair. \n\nAt this point, the would-be entrepreneur may be willing simply to sell the chair outright, or even abandon it, and head back to Brugge in defeat.\n\nBut before he does that, it's likely that he will wander along the beach for an hour or so, looking for dropped centimes and francs to help finance his purchase of a return ticket on the chemin de fer . . . .", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-3886403301-72157622338070202", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3886403301/#comment72157622338300980", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1252682747", "_content": "LOC -- Google maps says there is no &quot;h&quot; in Blankenberge.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-3886403301-72157622338300980", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3886403301/#comment72157622341444136", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1252708124", "_content": "Everyone, \n\nThanks for your comments! The caption of 'Blankenberghe, baigneurs' comes directly from the photochrom itself, and the English title is copied directly from the printed catalog produced by the Detroit Publishing Company.
