The abbey is at the (old) city border, the cathedral is in town center and used to be a parish church called St John's.\nIn 1539, when emperor Charles V humiliated the inhabitants of Ghent, he erected his Spaniards' Castle on the abbey grounds and forced the monks out.  Those found a new place in St John's church which became St Bavon church and later, in 1559, St Bavon cathedral.", "authorname": "avanherreweghe", "id": "8602872-3887188304-72157622514223633", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3887188304"}}
