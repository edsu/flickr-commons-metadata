She wasn't born with it; therefore, it was that much more frustrating for her when she obtained those disabilities.  That was probably a cause of her being so  uncooperative as a child.  Anne Macy Sullivan, her teacher, is shown in the picture by her side.  She helped Helen embrace her situation and learn to live to inspire others for years to come.  After researching, I strongly believe she is one of the main reasons why Helen became so famous.
