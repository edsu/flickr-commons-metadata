Aunt, so very removed but over the last 5 years we knew so little about our family on my dad's side I started searching.  \nI understand her father is related to General Robert Edward Lee.   His name was Robert James Lee,  I thought originally by the dates he was the general's son but not so.\nIf you might have any info on this to share it would be appreciated.  My big drive with family history too is that we have hardly any images of our ancestors, to this end it has been great finding about Auriol Lee.   What is your interest in her if its okay to ask ??\nClaire", "authorname": "claire1011", "id": "8602872-3085243880-72157624777400156", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3085243880"}}
