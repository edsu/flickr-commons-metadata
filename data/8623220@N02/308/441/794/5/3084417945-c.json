His nickname came from the fact that he was a Native American.  He was in the Cahuilla tribe, and his mother was a big part of his life.  He even altered his diploma from high school, because he didn't finish.  He took classes at Dartmouth with the help of a tutor, but was caught for having a false diploma.  Shortly after that, his baseball career began as a catcher.  \n\n<a href=\"http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;pid=9594&amp;bid=991\">bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;pid=9594&amp...</a>", "authorname": "fireworkbabe89", "id": "8602872-3084417945-72157610707108277", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3084417945"}}
