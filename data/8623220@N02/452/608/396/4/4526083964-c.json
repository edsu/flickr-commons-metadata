I was very lucky to know a guy who played for McGraw in the late 30's, Johnny McCarthy, a first baseman.  I was just a kid and McCarthy told me stories about McGraw.  At that point, I had never known a former ML ball player and I was fascinated that Johnny had played for the NY Giants.  I just remember him saying it was tough playing for McGraw and that McGraw knew more about baseball than anyone living then.", "authorname": "budderflyman", "id": "8602872-4526083964-72157623876565804", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4526083964"}}
