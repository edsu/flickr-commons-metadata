The compiler of <a href=\"http://www.bucovine.com/en/pages/culture/noailles.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bucovine.com/en/pages/culture/noailles.shtml</a> clearly thinks so.\n\nI don't see a date on the negative.  In 1913 (the date of most of the current batches of Bain photos uploaded to Flickr) she would have been 37.
