For example, Sir Isaac Isaacs a distinguished Governor-General in the 1930s who had no military background adopted this uniform:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/2869624206/\">www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/2869624206/</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://vrroom.naa.gov.au/print/?ID=19495\" rel=\"nofollow\">vrroom.naa.gov.au/print/?ID=19495</a>\n\nIncluding sword: <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.cat-vn582907\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.cat-vn582907</a>\n\nA  New South Wales Governor of the 1970s, Sir Roden Cutler, V.C. who had a distinguished military career took it upon himself to adopt a cocked hat for rare ceremonial occasions, although it had never been part of his former military uniform:\n\n<a href=\"http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/REL/18662.006\" rel=\"nofollow\">cas.awm.gov.au/item/REL/18662.006</a>\n\nNo matter how ridiculous the uniform, a Governor was well entitled to wear it as the occasion demanded, for example Sir Philip Game, Governor of New South Wales in 1932:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/2878526846/\">www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/2878526846/</a>", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "8602872-4526082384-72157623880513084", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4526082384/#comment72157623885655562", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1271641555", "_content": "@BobMeade, I love those uniforms!  I had been wondering if Weigall might have had a similar flight of fancy when he was High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1926.  However, whereas a cocked hat might be appropriate for a Governor (or a Sheriff), I doubt that a crown would be.  I think he's dressing as Richard I (Lionheart).
