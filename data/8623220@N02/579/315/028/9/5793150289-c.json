There is also a date stamp on the original picture which I'm reading as 9/15/14&mdash;which means the young princess could at the most be 14 years old. If the Bain practice of using archive photos of individuals for current events hold here too she's less than that, and the girl in the bottom photo is likely the young princess with her brother <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_II_of_Romania\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carol II</a>.
