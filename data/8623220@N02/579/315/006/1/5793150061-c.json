Born a granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, she was given the name Alexandra Feodorovna upon being received into the Russian Orthodox Church, which canonized her as Saint Alexandra the Passion Bearer in 2000.\nAlexandra is best remembered as the last Tsarina of Russia, as one of the most famous royal carriers of the haemophilia disease and for her support of autocratic control over the country. Her notorious friendship with the Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin was also an important factor in her life.\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4332082611/]", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-5793150061-72157626876521260", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5793150061/#comment72157626910268622", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1307483117", "_content": "Thanks trialsanderrors for the information about the tzarina.
