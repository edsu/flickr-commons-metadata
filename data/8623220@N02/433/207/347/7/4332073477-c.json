T.H. Bussey post\nDate: 13th May, 2012\n\nWystan -\nI just wanted to thank you for taking the time to correct the spelling error the Bain News made in identifying a picture of my great-great Uncle Sen. T.H. Bussey taken on the steps of the NY Capital Building in Albany, NY in 1913. I had been researching my Mother's family geneaology when I came across the picture of Sen. Bussey a couple of years ago and had no idea of how to correct the spelling mistake. Thank you for noting the error and requesting that the Library of Congress set the record straight. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to substantiate that you provided the correct spelling of the Bussey surname with the Library of Congress. Again, I thank you for your attention to the details of history. \n\nBest Regards - Ellen Doody edoodypdx@gmail.com", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4332073477-72157629726594120", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4332073477"}}
