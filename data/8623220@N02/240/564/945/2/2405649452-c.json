In a long, complex career, she was a pioneer settlement worker and founder of Hull House in Chicago, public philosopher (the first American woman in that role), sociologist, author, and leader in woman suffrage and world peace. She was the most prominent woman of the Progressive Era and helped turn the nation to issues of concern to mothers, such as the needs of children, public health and world peace. She emphasized that women have a special responsibility to clean up their communities and make them better places to live, arguing they needed the vote to be effective. Addams became a role model for middle-class women who volunteered to uplift their communities. She is increasingly being recognized as a member of the American pragmatist school of philosophy.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Addams\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Addams</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-2405649452-72157625301142682", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2405649452"}}
