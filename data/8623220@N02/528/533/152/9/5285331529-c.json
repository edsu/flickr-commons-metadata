By 1887, he was managing the Haymarket Theatre, winning praise for adventurous programming and lavish productions, and starring in many of its productions. In 1899, he helped fund the rebuilding, and became manager, of His Majesty's Theatre. Again, he promoted a mix of Shakespeare and classic plays with new works and adaptations of popular novels, giving them spectacular productions in this large house, and often playing leading roles. His wife, actress Helen Maud Holt, often played opposite him and assisted him with management of the theatres.\nAlthough Tree was regarded as a versatile and skilled actor, particularly in character roles, by his later years, his technique was seen as mannered and old fashioned. He founded the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1904 and was knighted, for his contributions to theatre, in 1909. His famous family includes his siblings, explorer Julius Beerbohm, author Constance Beerbohm and caricaturist Max Beerbohm. His daughters were the actresses Viola and Felicity and poet Iris, and his illegitimate children included film director Carol Reed. A grandson was the actor Oliver Reed.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Herbert_Tree\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Herbert_Tree</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-5285331529-72157625668098800", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5285331529/#comment72157625545482635", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1293304920", "_content": "Richard, wouldn't that have been &quot;Her&quot; Majesty's Theatre in 1899, and until Victoria's death, in 1901?", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5285331529-72157625545482635", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5285331529/#comment72157626538263319", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1304721445", "_content": "Bain/LOC photo of Edmund Gurney as Alfred Doolittle, in &quot;Pygmalion,&quot; posted to Flickr on May 6, 2011:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5693554659/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5285331529-72157626538263319", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5285331529"}}
