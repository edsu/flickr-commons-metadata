One time Professional Sculling Championship of England and challenger for the Professional Sculling Championship of the World.\n\nHe (if this is the same person) was born in 1868, Auckland, New Zealand. So in 1910 for example he would have been 48. This probably fits the age of the Tom Sullivan in the picture.\n\nBy 1910 Sullivan was a very successful rowing coach. Coaching mainly in Germany before WW1 until his death.\n\nWould the LOC collection be more likely to include sports 'stars' than attorneys? (I hope so).\n\nI have a younger photo of the rowing Tom Sullivan and it looks remarkably similar.\n\nHappy to provide more information on him.", "authorname": "mgracee", "id": "8602872-3277072686-72157617150827737", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3277072686/#comment72157617254956490", "realname": "Jeff", "path_alias": "jeff_loc", "author": "34997905@N03", "iconserver": "3319", "datecreate": "1240573284", "_content": "Thanks, mgracee.
