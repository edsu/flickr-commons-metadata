It is located in the Jefferson Memorial Building, home of the Missouri History Museum, 5700 Lindell Boulevard, St. Louis. The museum is on the site of the main entrance to the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, aka St. Louis World's Fair, and its construction was financed primarily by the proceeds of the fair. The fairgrounds are now the site of Forest Park.\n\nThe photo might have been taken at the time of the statue's unveiling, but might also have been published in newspapers two years later when, on April 10, 1915, sculptor Karl Bitter died of injuries received the previous night, when he had been struck by an automobile on Broadway in New York City after leaving the Metropolitan Opera House.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-3276256609-72157613764896725", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3276256609/#comment72157614425416206", "realname": "", "path_alias": "erotocratnyc", "author": "82395331@N00", "iconserver": "163", "datecreate": "1235584547", "_content": "Arguably, the most intelligent President ever!", "authorname": "Erotocrat", "id": "8602872-3276256609-72157614425416206", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "3276256609"}}
