The building on the left rear is 200 Park Avenue South (perhaps 4th Avenue when the picture was taken). The upper right hand corner of the picture seems to have a date written on a stamp.\n\nThere was a major commotion at the 1912 May Day celebration, at the north end of Union Square, where the American flag was ripped down from the speaker's platform (perhaps to the right of the picture) and trampled. A woman in the crowd eventually dusted the flag off and folded it on her arm. There is an American flag in the right center of the picture, but there isn't enough information in the picture for me to definitely place it in 1912.\n\nFor the full NYT account of the 1912 event see:\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A05E4DD153CE633A25751C0A9639C946396D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A05E4DD153CE633A...</a>", "authorname": "Homer 5004", "id": "8602872-3276254239-72157614046937525", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3276254239/#comment72157624513226613", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1280767995", "_content": "This photo is of the 1913 May Day rally, according to the date on the Bain News Agency's sticker, in the upper right hand corner.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-3276254239-72157624513226613", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3276254239"}}
