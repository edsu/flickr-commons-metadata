The idea of business as usual, in a time when a major chunk of the country was trying to secede, violating the Union? Ridiculous.\n\nFunny how people can't understand that in times of war, normal &quot;rights&quot; are removed. It's man against man, trying to take your LIFE -- how's that for a right removed? It's not a civilized thing, war. It totally abrogates the social contract and the most fundamental moral codes. This idea that there's an honorable way to conduct wars is asinine and shameful. It's what allows us to calmly enter into them in the first place, what allows us to be genuinely surprised that the whole endeavor isn't a neatly conducted game ... that makes it possible for anyone to be shocked that &quot;civilians&quot; are often put in harm's way. What? Is the horrid intent of war not clear? Does anyone think the human damage can really be contained to the poor pawns in uniform? Or that doing so would make the killing in any sense more morally just? Jesus help us, people are stupid. There are times when war is called for. But if you believe that, and enter into it, don't have on blinders.\n\nBy the way, the Union wasn't fighting to end slavery. The Union was fighting because those who wanted to preserve and spread the right to enslave, wanted to secede. The Union wanted the vast wealth of the natural resources in the south. They wanted to keep the contiguous land mass united. They couched it in terms of slavery, at times, because those were the terms by which secession was made. Yes, 18 months into the War, an emancipation proclamation was floated -- but emancipation would never have been a reason for war, on its own. Well, not from the Union offensive stance.", "authorname": "mesmerical", "id": "8602872-3253744672-72157613785798965", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3253744672/#comment72157613803808532", "realname": "hobvias sudoneighm", "path_alias": "striatic", "author": "34427466731@N01", "iconserver": "5341", "datecreate": "1234641254", "_content": "<i>&quot;None of his predecessors were dealing with a civil war.

The war wasn't on as large a scale as the civil war, but the idea that Lincoln was alone in facing an existential threat to the Union is unfounded. The revolutionary war itself was an existential threat to nationhood itself, and the people who fought it wrote the very provisions that Lincoln flaunted.\n\n<i>&quot;The idea of business as usual, in a time when a major chunk of the country was trying to secede, violating the Union?

If there's no functioning judiciary in an area of conflict, such chaos is inevitable and cruder methods of maintaining order are understandable.\n\nLincoln's issue was that he suspended habeus corpus in areas with functional courts, well within union territory. he essentially short circuited a functional judicial system.\n\nwas this necessary? i'm not sure. maybe. but it was certainly a power grab and set a precedent for a consolidation of executive power that continues to this day.", "authorname": "striatic", "id": "8602872-3253744672-72157613803808532", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3253744672/#comment72157613788230783", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jlmiller", "author": "19959407@N00", "iconserver": "8399", "datecreate": "1234641812", "_content": "I said none of his predecessors faced a *civil* war.\n\nAs for his tactics re the judicial system -- the thrust of my comment was meant to say, if killing is okay, why should other rights be safe? To pretend any other kinds of rights should be carefully handled, if the right to life is being systematically taken away, is a philosophically absurd notion. That we can both have a designated time of killing those with whom we do not agree, and parade about like idiots, keeping to the letter of all other man-made laws -- that's what allows such brutality to happen, the idea that when we're engaging in the absolute antithesis of our reason for being (sustenance of life) by killing each other, we can still be &quot;civilized&quot; and orderly. Putting war in a context like that -- even expecting it -- means one is not possibly grasping how very wrong it is to kill, as if the killing is less of a transgression than imprisonment or loss of privacy, or even torture.\n\nAnd again, I don't think all war is wrong. But understand that it is utterly anti-social, anti-life, anti-civility. To expect otherwise is to be naive, and disappointed. Just because during some wars we *have* maintained levels of continuity of our governmental systems, and maintained the everyday workings of the social contract, doesn't impress me as good.

You do your best with information at hand, when quick decisions must be made -- just as I'm sure there were men with guns on fields, unable to tell for sure who was the enemy.

The law protects civil order. It's possible to do so in a way that hinders human rights, in fact. Our system is not one that does so, it's true that we seek to optimize human rights in the pursuit and maintenance of peace. But in a time of war, when one feels the populace is threatened, it may be that maintaining civil order and the safety of the majority, means there will be some whose human rights will be compromised. Not nice? Well, don't have a war. \n\nLincoln didn't randomly take away rights of his own citizens. It seems he believed himself unable to secure the safety of the greater number, without suspending habeas corpus. As I understand it, he wasn't happy to act outside of the Constitutional provisions, he believed it to be a genuinely necessary matter of expediency. And in the context, I don't think it can be well argued that he was wrong. The men he sought to snare were not &quot;his own,&quot; they were the enemy, among his own. I made the analogy above, I'll make it again: if you are in a battle, and you are going to judge the entire success in terms of losses by friendly fire, you ought not be in the battle in the first place. If you aren't ready to sacrifice yourselves a bit to quash the opponent, the opponent wasn't worth fighting. Lincoln believed the Union was worth preserving. He was in the fight to win. He sacrificed the lives of many, many men to do so. Did the possibility that a few of the suspected traitors he imprisoned and/or executed were innocent, weigh heavily on his mind? I've no idea. It had to have been balanced by the responsibility he felt to the entire Union, acknowledging the risk that real traitors would have posed to a great number of men.\n\nIt's not an exact science, this playing about with morality. That's what I'm saying -- once you're in a war, it's not as black and white as it is in peacetime.

To them, the right to privacy and liberty was as important as food because those ideals translate into the right to be personally sovereign, to having the power to secure resources, and have that effort be wholly beneficial to them, over the long run.

Lincoln's actions were to create a civil war, to continue subjugation and theft of wealth.  He effected this by blatantly contravening the constitution, and by so doing set the precedence for the mess we have today.  His words and speeches are many, but I find his pre-presidency stage to be most revealing.  To anyone who thinks Lincoln was an advocate of freedom and equality, well pls read this quote....\n\n&quot;I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.&quot;       \u2015 U.S. Senate candidate Abraham Lincoln, 1858.\n\nIsn't history interesting?", "authorname": "ronghualu", "id": "8602872-3253744672-72157624353429432", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3253744672/#comment72157625192007003", "realname": "Pierre Ntekwa Don-Lomingo", "path_alias": "ntekwa", "author": "55539497@N02", "iconserver": "4045", "datecreate": "1288955288", "_content": "These are people that shouldn't be forgotten in the American History.", "authorname": "peterntekwa", "id": "8602872-3253744672-72157625192007003", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "3253744672"}}
