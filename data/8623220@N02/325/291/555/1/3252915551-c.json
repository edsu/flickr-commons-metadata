If you look at one of the archival TIFFs on the LOC website, which have much higher resolution, you can see several signs on the buildings; they're not flipped.\n\nHere's the explanation: Remember that this is a glass plate negative; it's simply a big, clear glass shelf with photographic emulsion coated on it.  (The Victorians didn't have the plastics used in modern &quot;film&quot;; the best they could do was clunky, fragile glass.)  So, the unknown archivist who wrote &quot;lincoln's funeral&quot; simply wrote it on the wrong side of the plate, so that it came out backward when printed.  It didn't really matter, since the text was intended to be cropped out of prints anyway.  It was just there as an indexing aid.", "authorname": "Matt Stevens", "id": "8602872-3252915551-72157613493200614", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3252915551/#comment72157613499241603", "realname": "", "path_alias": "lillyiggylove", "author": "21158959@N02", "iconserver": "4022", "datecreate": "1234148133", "_content": "Very moving.
