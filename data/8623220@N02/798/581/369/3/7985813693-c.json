Although breaker boys were primarily children, elderly coal miners who could no longer work in the mines because of age, disease, or accident were also sometimes employed as breaker boys. The use of breaker boys began in the mid-1860s. Although public disapproval of the employment of children as breaker boys existed by the mid-1880s, the practice did not end until the 1920s.&quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-7985813693-72157631563359156", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7985813693/#comment72157631578568775", "realname": "", "path_alias": "bellster", "author": "40708286@N07", "iconserver": "3500", "datecreate": "1348107171", "_content": "The expressions say it all.", "authorname": "PETER9914 Exploring the D7000", "id": "8602872-7985813693-72157631578568775", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7985813693/#comment72157632175102215", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "62694368@N02", "iconserver": "8320", "datecreate": "1354729552", "_content": "i live in the welsh valleys of south wales and this is a story of just one of many child colliers dated 1850 FIVE MINUTE MAN     OH DAD take me home,take me home to mam,i dont like this cruel dark.OH LAD with a childs tongue,you have tasted too soon,the wrath of being a man.OH DAD take me home,take me home to mam,COME LAD youve been a five minute  man,ill take you home to mam,and you can be a child again.", "authorname": "towner1705", "id": "8602872-7985813693-72157632175102215", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "7985813693"}}
