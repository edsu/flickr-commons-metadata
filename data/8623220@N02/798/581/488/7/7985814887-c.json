I was surprised to find no wikipedia (or other internet) full biographical sketch of Poynter, as she was clearly a top actress of the era, both on stage and later screen.  She also wrote many plays, screenplays for films, and even had a spin as a pulp fiction novelist later in her career.  I imagine her life story is very interesting.  This image is dated 1910.  I guess the theater was still putting on legitimate theater or vaudeville at that point, so it was probably a stage production.  Poynter was born in Missouri and would have been 24 in 1910.\n\nI wonder if she played both the Little Lord and his mother, as Mary Pickford did later.", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-7985814887-72157631537590114", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7985814887/#comment72157631538106651", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11418107@N02", "iconserver": "1068", "datecreate": "1347673008", "_content": "Yes, Beulah needs a wikipedia entry.
