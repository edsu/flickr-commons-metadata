And <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bstrong/292792682/\">here</a> is a photo of a KRIT car with the symbol from another Flickr user. Looking at the photo large, I can see a similar logo above the radiator on this car--seems to identify it as a KRIT car. Perhaps some car fanatic out there can tell us the exact model.\n\nThis use of the swastika symbol, of course, predates its adoption by Nazi Germany--it was a widespread symbol in many cultures, see, for instance <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> and <a href=\"http://history1900s.about.com/cs/swastika/a/swastikahistory.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">history1900s.about.com/cs/swastika/a/swastikahistory.htm</a>. The latter has a good summary of its use at the time of this photo:\n\n<i>Even in the early twentieth century, the swastika was still a symbol with positive connotations. For instance, the swastika was a common decoration that often adorned cigarette cases, postcards, coins, and buildings. During World War I, the swastika could even be found on the shoulder patches of the American 45th Division and on the Finnish air force until after World War II.</i>", "authorname": "cotinis", "id": "8602872-2765464748-72157606761606761", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2765464748/#comment72157606913654439", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "80278590@N00", "iconserver": "7401", "datecreate": "1219529540", "_content": "The swastika is a symbol which predates the third reich by a millennium or two.

The top of the radiator shell was peaked, not flat, like the one on the bus in this photo. See the photo of the 1910 model in the Detroit News article mentioned above. The 1912 models were almost identical.  Moreover, car makers didn't paint large corporate logos on the sides of the hoods.\n\nSomething else is going on here.
