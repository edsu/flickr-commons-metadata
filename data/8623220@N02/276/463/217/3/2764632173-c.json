He ruled for 50 years but was assassinated during the Balkan Wars on March 18, 1913. He was the grandfather of England's Prince Phillip. He lay in state in Greece for five days, so the services here would have coincided with his funeral in Greece.\n\nI couldn't find a photo of a Greek Orthodox church in New York to match this. But I did find that the Holy Trinity Church on 72nd Street burned down in 1927.
