The German Kaiser Wilhelm II had taken enormous interest in Ballin\u2019s new trio, and now he was the one to lead the ceremony. Just below where the Imperator\u2019s giant bow towered an ornamented platform had been built for the Kaiser and his staff. The Kaiser himself had dressed in his Admiral suite and he ascended the platform together with Albert Ballin [the ship's creator]. After the Kaiser\u2019s speech when he was just to christen the ship, a piece of lumber fell from the ship\u2019s bow and nearly hit the sovereign. This was seen as a bad omen by many, but the ceremony ended happily, at least.&quot;\n\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.greatoceanliners.net/imperator.html\">Imperator/Berengaria: 1913 - 1938</a> from the Great Ocean Liners website.", "authorname": "No\u00ebl Zia Lee", "id": "8602872-2764633459-72157606750689165", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2764633459/#comment72157606835319309", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11572312@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1219176135", "_content": "The Kaiser loved the military and he loved his uniforms (article above mentions him dressing in his admiral's uniform).

A commander; a leader; an emperor; -- originally an appellation of honor by which Roman soldiers saluted their general after an important victory.
