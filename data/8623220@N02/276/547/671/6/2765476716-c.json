They cycled out to Whitstone from their employer's office in Holsworthy, about 8 miles, and were admitted by her father Dr Wharry. When they explained their business he refused to let them see his daughter and locked them in his study. After a long while they were released and told to leave, taking the writ with them. As they left one of them flung the writ on the doorstep. This was held to be effective service. Dr Wharry flew into a rage and, calling his servants, chased them off the premises. Dr Wharry was subsequently prosecuted for assaulting a process server acting in the course of his duties and stood trial at the Old Bailey in London, initially pleading Not Guilty. My father and his colleague were ordered to attend as prosecution witnesses. Neither had been east of Exeter before and it was a great adventure. When they arrived in London they were told that the case would start a day late. The only place in London they had heard of was Madam Tussaud's waxworks and so they spent the day there. In the event Dr Wharry changed his plea to Guilty and their evidence was not required. My father had never before then slept a night away from home. The writ to be served on Miss Wharry related to the arson at Kew but I do not know if it was a civil claim for damages or a criminal summons.
