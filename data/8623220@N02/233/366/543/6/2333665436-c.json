The trip was an adventure: the vessel's freeboard was only 21/2 feet so she was usually awash and always rolling; the engine noise was deafening; and the boat caught fire and nearly blew up. After completing the rugged North Sea leg, Day writes, &quot;...The last thing I did was to visit the engine room and kiss the motor good-bye...&quot;\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting of course to be able to identify the people in the photograph. From the Scripps site there is mention of Scripps having a children. It would be possible that could be him in the suit, and maybe his child christening the ship. - just a guess though", "authorname": "porkfork6", "id": "8602872-2333665436-72157604117280640", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2333665436/#comment72157604123861319", "realname": "", "path_alias": "maxedaperture", "author": "19185411@N00", "iconserver": "37", "datecreate": "1205580663", "_content": "This shot is great!

He arranged with the Brooklyn Yacht Club to start it the race in New York Bay, and with the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club to finish it off St. David\u2019s Light.
