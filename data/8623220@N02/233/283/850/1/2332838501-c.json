'\r\n\r\nAnd from <a href=\"http://www.belhurstcastle.com/whitehistory.html\">www.belhurstcastle.com/whitehistory.html</a>\r\n'Sunday, September 1, 1912, was a day of disaster for White Springs Farm and the immediate vicinity. A cyclone wrought havoc, leveling the main group of dairy barns and uprooting most of the beautiful elms on the farm. A three-quarter ton dinner bell from one of the barns was found a half-mile away. Miraculously, there was no loss of human life, though four or five calves were killed. Clean-up operations were extensive, and tree experts were brought in to salvage what trees could be saved. Mr. Lewis sold the Guernseys, rather than replace the barns. By 1920 the cattle business was over.'\r\n\r\nSince then, the farm has apparently been a poultry farm, an orchard, a home for the elderly, and is now a hotel and winery.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-2332838501-72157604170259064", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2332838501/#comment72157604173716410", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ootyalleppey", "author": "22349924@N08", "iconserver": "2368", "datecreate": "1206031083", "_content": ":)", "authorname": "jdeavin", "id": "8602872-2332838501-72157604173716410", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2332838501/#comment72157623612237716", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1268501368", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1094352@N23/\">sad world</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-2332838501-72157623612237716", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2332838501/#comment72157623487716187", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1268501377", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/591987@N24/\">soulful group</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-2332838501-72157623487716187", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2332838501/#comment72157623612239168", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1268501386", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1050819@N21/\">a new world</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-2332838501-72157623612239168", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2332838501/#comment72157623612239928", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1268501394", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/898180@N25/\">Music,Quotes,Lyrics,etc of the World</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-2332838501-72157623612239928", "iconfarm": 7}], "photo_id": "2332838501"}}
