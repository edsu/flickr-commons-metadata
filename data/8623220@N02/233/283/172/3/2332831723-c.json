The scenery is very reminiscent of the Rhine Gorge between Bingen and Koblenz: the valley is very narrow and the rail line is right up on the left bank. There are a number of cliffs and bends in the gorge, so I'm not certain that it is the Loreley, but the tags should probably read &quot;Koblenz&quot;, &quot;Rhine Gorge&quot;, &quot;Middle Rhine Valley&quot; and &quot;Rhineland-Palatinate&quot; rather than the last four.", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-2332831723-72157606718515496", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2332831723/#comment72157608787660122", "realname": "Patrick Lehnes", "path_alias": "belenus1414", "author": "99441634@N00", "iconserver": "2043", "datecreate": "1226249896", "_content": "Hi, I am a geographer living at Freiburg (Black Forest), I agree with trailsanderrors.
