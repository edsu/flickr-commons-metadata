His successor and predecessor was Manuel Bonilla.\n\nBertrand started out with a reputation as a conciliator, but during his last presidency was involved in armed conflict with his political opponents. It is believed that United States of America pressure was behind his abandoning the post of President. He spent the next few years in exile before returning to La Ceiba, Honduras to die in July 1926.\n\nSource:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Bertrand\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Bertrand</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-3201917010-72157612684709023", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3201917010/#comment72157612739876806", "realname": "", "path_alias": "rm996s", "author": "25666949@N06", "iconserver": "3189", "datecreate": "1232342550", "_content": "Great Shot!
