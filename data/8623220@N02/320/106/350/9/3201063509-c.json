He was fighting Joe Stecher. I found a reference to an earlier fight between Hussane and Stecher on November 25, 1915, at Lincoln, Nebraska <a href=\"http://scratchpad.wikia.com/wiki/Professional_Wrestling_November_1915\">(on this web page)</a>. Another bout pairing the long-time rivals took place in Atlanta in 1923. He also fought Stanislaus Zbyszko at least once, in July, 1924, at the Los Angeles Philharmonic Auditorium, of all places.\n\nOther records on the Internet refer to Hussane as Bulgarian or Turkish, and he is sometimes referred to by the nickname &quot;The Terrible Turk.&quot; I can't find any references to him fighting anywhere other than the U.S., though. He was managed for a while by American sport promoter Jack Curley, according to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Curley\">Curley's Wikipedia biography</a>.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-3201063509-72157612662247446", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3201063509/#comment72157612675750216", "realname": "", "path_alias": "celtico", "author": "30817808@N00", "iconserver": "3822", "datecreate": "1232202318", "_content": "It was another, earlier Ottoman or Balkan wrestler,  Youssuf Ishmaelo, the Terrible Turk: the original (1) , in fact, of all the &quot;Terrible Turks&quot; who invaded western wrestling arenas over the past century,  this original via France.\nIsmael Yousouf, known as the 'Terrible Turk'' to the wrestlers all over the world, was a steerage passenger on board La Bourgogne which sank in 1898. He was heading to Turkey/Ottoman Empire on the French transatlantic boat called La Bourgogne on May 21, 1898. But he couldn't end up in Istanbul and got drowned around the Sable Island (60 miles northeast to NY) due to a clash with an Irish cargo liner on July 4, 1898. His body was lost in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nHe was born in Shumia, Turkey [now part of Bulgaria], thirty-five years ago. He was six feet two inches in height and weighted 240 pounds.Shortly after his victory over Lewis, Ismail took the first ship back to Europe where he reportedly planned to open a coffee or bazar in his native village of Scutari [in present day Albania].\n\n\nTHIS photographed GUY is another Yussif Hussane (2) who on either January 13, or January 15, 1917 he wrestled with Irishman Pat Connolly (who then himself went missing?) and they battled to a 2 1/2 hour draw in Butte, Montana, USA .\n\nLater in Chicago IL: March 1, 1919: Hussane has been removed to the Garfield Boulevard Hospital here for treatment of an internal ailment that is puzzling the doctors. The wrestler was taken sick about 12 weeks ago and has had no relief since that time. He weighs but 159 pounds now where before he tipped the scales at 210. He has not appeared on the mat for the last four months and is under the care of Dr. B.W. Sippy. He was still wrestling until 1936.", "authorname": "mikescottnz", "id": "8602872-3201063509-72157612675750216", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3201063509/#comment72157623067694752", "realname": "", "path_alias": "battalgazi", "author": "10879063@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1261759647", "_content": "After the La Bourgogne sank Youssuf Ishmaelo swam to a rescue boat and hang on to board.
