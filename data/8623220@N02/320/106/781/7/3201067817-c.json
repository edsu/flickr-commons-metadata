Larson is Arnold Lawson.  His wife's maiden name was Lucie Mitchell.  Arnold was the eldest son of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_W._Lawson_(businessman)\">Thomas W. Lawson</a>. (NY Times, December 17, 1905)\n\nIt's tough to make out the month on the left, but it appears to say 3/21/20.  \n\nAccording to an October 3, 1922 NYTimes article, their fortunes were soon in peril.  At that point Arnold's father Thomas W. Lawson was forced to sell his estate Dreamwold on the coast of <a href=\"http://www.town.scituate.ma.us/\">Scituate, Massachusetts</a> at a huge loss.  Included in the estate was a &quot;prized lot of police dogs&quot;.  The article mentions, &quot;After [the death of Mrs. Lawson], and with the marriage of all of their children, [Thomas W.] Lawson found the great place lonely.&quot;  He'd tried many hobbies such as bulldog breeding and given up on them, finally settling on trading in the stock market and breeding police dogs.\n\nI'm not clear on what exactly caused his economic hardships, but it has to do with a &quot;Haskell failure&quot;.\n\nSo enough about the people!  Let's hear about the dogs!\n\nDreamwold Irish Boy is the bulldog. Is Noswal Neto a Pekingese?\n\nPresumably D. Irish Boy was long retired at this point.\n\nNYTimes has Dreamwold Irish Boy winning several awards:\n\nFeb 20, 1913.  Westminster. Dreamwold Irish Boy wins &quot;Bulldogs. Open. Dogs (45 pounds and over)&quot;.  Mentions that Thomas W. Lawson had just spent $17,000 to bring four dogs from England with hopes of cleaning up the show, but it didn't work. D. Irish Boy wasn't one of them.\n\nNov 5, 1913 - Thomas W. Lawson's Dreamwold Irish Boy wins Bulldog Club of America.  Shown by &quot;The Young Mr. Lawson&quot;, presumably Arnold.\n\nFeb 25, 1914 - Dreamwold Irish Boy took second place at Westminster; a different Dreamworld took second place the year before.\n\nMay 10, 1914 - Irish boy took second in bulldog show, owner listed as Thomas W. Lawson.  Lawson's Dreamwold Merry Boy had recently won the Bulldog Club of America.\n\nMay 24, 1914 - &quot;Irish Boy Best in Show&quot;; lists owner as Arnold Lawson; Nassau Kennel Club annual dog show, among 600 entries; also won best Bulldog, beating English prize dog.  Oddly, the same article later on says that Lawson's dog Dreamwold Centaur won a special prize available to members only.\n\nAlso, in 2002 the Scituate Historical Society published a book about Dreamwold: <a href=\"http://www.scituatehistoricalsociety.org/gift_home.html\">Beauty, Strength, Speed: Celebrating 100 Years of Thomas W. Lawson's Dreamwold</a>", "authorname": "Rob Ketcherside", "id": "8602872-3201067817-72157612616489777", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3201067817/#comment72157612719865413", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1232415414", "_content": "Lucie Mitchell was formerly married to Herbert Barnum Seeley. according to NYT article from December 17, 1905:\nARNOLD LAWSON ENGAGED.; Eldest Son of Thomas W. to Marry the Former Mrs. Herbert Seeley.  <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9505E5DB153AE733A25754C1A9649D946497D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9505E5DB153AE733A...</a>\n\nThe article notes that her former husband was last heard of as a ticket-seller at the Hippodrome!!", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-3201067817-72157612719865413", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3201067817/#comment72157612720219697", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1232416078", "_content": "The March 1920 issue of Dogdom [see <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=aHcCAAAAYAAJ\">books.google.com/books?id=aHcCAAAAYAAJ</a> ] suggests that Noswal Neto was a Pekingese\n\nPage 47 has an ad:\nIMPORTED STUD and puppies\u2014Noswal Neto, the sensational stud Pekingese.

Seeley, of the 'Seeley dinner' fame.&quot; The famed Seeley dinner was an 1896 private restaurant dinner busted by the police because of the nearly nude women dancers, especially the one called &quot;Little Egypt&quot;. Herbert Seeley was the dinner's host. He married Lucie in 1900, who seems to have divorced him 1903; a first article, that they were at court, gives his worth at $400,000; the article announcing the divorce says he spent his 1900 inheritance within a few years. That, from the previous incident, isn't hard to imagine. (I read about it, BTW, in Kenneth Whyte's <i>The Uncrowned King: The Sensational Rise of William Randolph Heart</i>, which is on my list of the best books that crossed my desk last year.)\n\n(And yes, Boston Ave. still is - in Toronto's east end, which would have been relatively undeveloped  or recently developed at the time.)", "authorname": "L\u00fa_", "id": "8602872-3201067817-72157612902929908", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3201067817/#comment72157612903478064", "realname": "Stephanie Fysh", "path_alias": "lu_", "author": "61361160@N00", "iconserver": "5330", "datecreate": "1232729062", "_content": "Last pieces for now! Though I'm intrigued by the dogs being important enough to name. Lucie was only 17 when she married Seeley, and 20 at that divorce. She was out of the picture by the time her father-in-law Thomas's fortune collapsed. Her husband sued her for divorce in 1920, naming one Leonard Lawrence as co-respondent; she claimed desertion. They had four children at the time.
