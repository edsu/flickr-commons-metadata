The Yankees moved across Manhattan to share the Polo Grounds with the NL's Giants (who had briefly used Hilltop Park as a home in 1911 when an earlier version of the Polo Grounds caught on fire). They were the Giants' tenants for another decade until moving across the Harlem River to the Bronx in 1923. Hilltop Park is now the site of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.", "authorname": "VPaterno19", "id": "8602872-3201064665-72157612761862326", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3201064665/#comment72157612906899227", "realname": "", "path_alias": "xapdal", "author": "8877550@N08", "iconserver": "2404", "datecreate": "1232841792", "_content": "needs to be renamed, instead of Chacago it should be Chicago, sadly it will never be renamed because this is the government...", "authorname": "Xapdal", "id": "8602872-3201064665-72157612906899227", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3201064665/#comment72157624662123919", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1282536311", "_content": "Other Bain/LOC photos of Shano Collins:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2658044159/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4909923511/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-3201064665-72157624662123919", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3201064665"}}
