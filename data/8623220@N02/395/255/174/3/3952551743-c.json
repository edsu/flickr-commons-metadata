It was designed by W. Liance Cottrell (1868-1964), and erected in 1910. The final result closely resembles the design of this tabletop model, but some details (notably the swag decorations on the dome) were omitted or altered. A half-dozen individual sculptors contributed the various statues and bas reliefs that adorn the monument.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-3952551743-72157622340682561", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3952551743"}}
