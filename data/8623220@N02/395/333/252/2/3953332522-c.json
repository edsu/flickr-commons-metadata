I guess that why we could get their broadcasts in my home town of Dallas, Texas, back in the early 1940's.\n\nIf my daddy could have a team then i could pick my own. There was a baseball board game made by caddco Ellis(SP) called baseball allstar game.\nI saw a card with the name Johnny mize. He became my hero. He was a giant.\nI read and reread the history of the Giants. nammes like Christy mathewson,and Frankie Frisch. Mell ott and the great left hander Carl Hubbell. \nI was hooked.
