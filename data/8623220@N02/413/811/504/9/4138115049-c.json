One component of the event was a competition for the newly developed motorized pumper.  On September 3 at 6:30 a.m., the 12-hour pump test began with 11 pieces of apparatus competing.  A  length of hard suction hose was used by each engine to draft water from the Hudson River.  \n\nOverall performance of the equipment was determined by using a point system.  The motor had to remaining running during the complete 12-hour test period.\n\nApparatus from the following companies began the event.\n\nAhrens-Fox\nAmerican LaFrance - Two units\nKnox\nLuietweiler\nNott - Two units  \nRobinson - Two units\nSeagrave\nWaterous\n\nEight of the engines completed the test.  The Luietweiler, one Nott and one Robinson failed.  The Ahrens-Fox earned the highest score.\n\nIn addition to this information, I have added notes to the other photos in this grouping.\n\nIn this photo: One of the Robinsons is pumping.  Most fire apparatus of this era were equipped with hard rubber tires.", "authorname": "kyfireenginephoto", "id": "8602872-4138115049-72157622814198853", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "4138115049"}}
