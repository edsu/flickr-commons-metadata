Because the incorruptible Gaynor would not cooperate with the Tammany machine, Tammany refused to nominate him for a second term. So Gaynor was renominated by an independent group, and accepted their nomination. In this photo, the independents are on their way to notify Gaynor of the nomination, just before he sailed to Europe on a vacation voyage. On September 10, exactly a week after this photo was taken, Gaynor died of a heart attack, in his deck chair aboard the steamship Baltic, 400 miles off the coast of Ireland.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4138877806-72157622812930543", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4138877806"}}
