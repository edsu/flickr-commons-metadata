I think it's somewhat inconclusive which Coolidge this might be, as both C.A. Coolidge and T.J. Coolidge are mentioned as playing in a November 1914 game in <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9402EFD6133DE333A2575BC0A9679D946596D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article from the New York Times</a>.  There is a photo in the article, but it's hard to say if it's the Coolidge pictured here, particularly if these two Coolidges happen to be brothers and share similar features.  \n\nWe will add a bit more to this description, since it doesn't mention Harvard or football, but may leave the identity a bit vague for now.
