Usually the agency collecting the guns from various jurisdictions is a State Police force. The guns have been used in crimes, or seized during domestic quarrels, or voluntarily surrendered by members of the public. The order to destroy them comes from a judge, often at the end of a criminal trial. Sometimes, if a weapon is unusual, a police agency will ask the judge for permission to keep the weapon for training purposes, or for use by a SWAT team. In Connecticut, until 1992, confiscated guns were not scrapped, but sold to the public at auction.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4818014129-72157624437030591", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818014129/#comment72157624561807540", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1279850390", "_content": "Another Bain/LOC photo shows a high-ranking police officer throwing these guns into the sea:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818636438/in/photostream/]\n\nYet another Bain/LOC photo of the forfeited guns aboard ship:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4909923045/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4818014129-72157624561807540", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818014129/#comment72157624439438267", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "15283643@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1279887456", "_content": "Thanks for the background info, Wystan!", "authorname": "technogeo", "id": "8602872-4818014129-72157624439438267", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818014129/#comment72157624439482969", "realname": "Amit Atar", "path_alias": "amitatar", "author": "50893790@N03", "iconserver": "4115", "datecreate": "1279888089", "_content": "they look old :)", "authorname": "Amit Atar", "id": "8602872-4818014129-72157624439482969", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818014129/#comment72157624440500797", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "15283643@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1279899948", "_content": "Are you referring to the guns or Wystan and myself?  \n\n(couldn't resist!)", "authorname": "technogeo", "id": "8602872-4818014129-72157624440500797", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818014129/#comment72157624565630256", "realname": "Melissa Etheridge", "path_alias": "melissareeseetheridge", "author": "46604724@N07", "iconserver": "2691", "datecreate": "1279904443", "_content": "I will not carry a gun....
