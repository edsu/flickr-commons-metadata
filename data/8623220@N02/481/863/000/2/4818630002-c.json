A comic artist for Red Book magazine, in that year he illustrated numerous Red Book stories written by the humorist Ellis Parker Butler (who is now best remembered for his story, &quot;Pigs Is Pigs.) Before WWI, Irvin also contributed a steady stream of illustrations to the old &quot;Life&quot; magazine, a humor weekly.\n\nIrvin in 1925 became the first art editor of a new magazine, &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; for which he designed the first cover, a portrait of Eustace Tilley, the supercilious Regency fop who became the magazine's symbol.\nTilley's pose is parodied here:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/idogcow/4289390151/]\n\nRea Irvin's Wikipedia bio:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rea_Irvin\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rea_Irvin</a>", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4818630002-72157624499025071", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818630002/#comment72157624499090355", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1280605614", "_content": "Other Bain/LOC photos of guests at a costume party in New York (the lacy backdrop in all seven photos is the same):\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818008811/in/photostream/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818008623/in/photostream/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818007483/in/photostream/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818008353/in/photostream/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818007979/in/photostream/]\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818630464/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4818630002-72157624499090355", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4818630002"}}
