It was her third visit to the USA, where she had scheduled a busy fundraising lecture tour. Her companion on the voyage was Rheta Childe Dorr; the ladies filled time during the seven days at sea compiling Pankhurst's autobiography (Dorr in the role of stenographer, Pankhurst dictating) -- a book published in 1914 (and now available to readers online, via Google Books). \n\nBut back home, Pankhurst was in trouble with the law, and U. S. immigration authorities, anticipating her arrival, used that as a pretext to deny her entry to the States -- indeed, they held an emergency hearing, declared her undesirable, and decided to send her back to England immediately -- meanwhile holding her and Ms. Dorr in comfortable quarters at Ellis Island. Newspaper publicity, and protests by American suffragists -- including Pankhurst's would-be hostess, Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont, one of the richest women in America -- embarrassed the government, and made it necessary for President Woodrow Wilson personally to intervene to have Mrs. Pankhurst released. The controversy brought a publicity windfall, greatly enhancing donations to the suffragist cause.\n\nNew York Times story on Wilson's intervention, October 20, 1913:\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9505EEDD1E3BE633A25753C2A9669D946296D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9505E...</a>\n\nAnother 1913 Bain/LOC photo of Mrs. Pankhurst, the canny publicity monger:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818632528/in/photostream/]\n\nFLASHBACK: On November 27, 1911, during an earlier visit to New York City, Emmeline Pankhurst attempted to convert a hostile crowd of young male yahoos in Wall Street, by lecturing from the back seat of an open automobile.
