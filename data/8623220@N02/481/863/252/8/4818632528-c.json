It was her third visit to the USA, where she had scheduled a busy fundraising lecture tour. Her companion on the voyage was Rheta Childe Dorr; the ladies filled time during seven days at sea compiling Pankhurst's autobiography (Dorr in the role of stenographer, Mrs. Pankhurst dictating) -- a book published in 1914 (and now available to readers online, via Google Books). \n\nBut back home, Pankhurst was in trouble with the law, and U. S. immigration authorities, anticipating her arrival, used her legal troubles as a pretext to accuse her of &quot;moral turpitude,&quot; denying her entry to the States -- indeed, they held an emergency hearing and decided to send her back to England immediately. Meanwhile she and Ms. Dorr were held in comfortable quarters at Ellis Island. The resultant newspaper publicity, and protests by American suffragists -- including Pankhurst's would-be hostess, Mrs. Oliver Hazzard Perry Belmont, one of the richest women in America -- embarrassed the government, and made it necessary for President Woodrow Wilson personally to intervene to have Mrs. Pankhurst released. The controversy brought a publicity windfall, greatly enhancing donations to the suffragist cause.\n\nNew York Times story, October 20, 1913:\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9505EEDD1E3BE633A25753C2A9669D946296D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9505E...</a>\n\nHere is another Bain/LOC photo from October, 1913 -- taken while Pankhurst and Dorr were being held at Ellis Island, pending deportation:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818632678/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4818632528-72157624571049132", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818632528/#comment72157624477577631", "realname": "Barbara", "path_alias": "barbara_loc", "author": "33593953@N02", "iconserver": "3267", "datecreate": "1280332799", "_content": "Wystan: Thanks for the additional context.
