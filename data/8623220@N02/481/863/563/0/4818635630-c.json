So, is this DePalma? Might be -- and maybe he was planning to repeat his feat now, in 1914?\n\nBraender Bulldog tires were manufactured by a company in East Rutherford, New Jersey, that had been founded in 1912 by Philip Braender, a German immigrant. (When Braender died in 1916, he left a million bucks to his wife and children. The tire company continued on into the 1920s.)\n\ntechnogeo points out that this photo was taken by an Indianapolis studio -- so, presumably in Indianapolis. De Palma won the Indy 500 race in 1915 (and nearly won in 1912) driving a Mercedes racer. He won other races elsewhere as well, in Mercedes.\n\nHis Wikipedia bio includes a photo of him with his riding mechanic, Tom Alley, in his 1912 Indy car. It probably was this one -- which is now an exhibit in the Indy hall of fame museum.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4818635630-72157624437438629", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818635630/#comment72157624437864211", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1279861335", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_De_Palma\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_De_Palma</a>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Braender\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Braender</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-4818635630-72157624437864211", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818635630/#comment72157624565626524", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "91829349@N00", "iconserver": "5466", "datecreate": "1279904406", "_content": "Notice the chain drive mechanism under the driver...", "authorname": "rjones0856", "id": "8602872-4818635630-72157624565626524", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818635630/#comment72157624565731054", "realname": "Scott Kraft", "path_alias": "sakraft1", "author": "61941044@N00", "iconserver": "6", "datecreate": "1279905462", "_content": "cool :)", "authorname": "sakraft1", "id": "8602872-4818635630-72157624565731054", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818635630/#comment72157624443897843", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "15283643@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1279939868", "_content": "White/light grey tires with smooth treads!", "authorname": "technogeo", "id": "8602872-4818635630-72157624443897843", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818635630/#comment72157624614921004", "realname": "", "path_alias": "shallsea", "author": "21513358@N02", "iconserver": "1", "datecreate": "1280488066", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1416109@N25/\">Bia\u0142o-czarne i czarno-bia\u0142e (W&amp;B and B&amp;W)</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "ciguena", "id": "8602872-4818635630-72157624614921004", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "4818635630"}}
