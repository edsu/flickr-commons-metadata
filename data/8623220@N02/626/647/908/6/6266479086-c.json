Most recently, the jeweler looked in vain for a pair of earrings. At one point, he approached Paul Gruault and said kindly: Could you help me in my research?\n\nPaul Gruault  hesitated, turned pale and asked leave of absence. The next day, he did not come to the store. He was thought ill, they would learn at his home. He had not returned since twenty-four hours. The jeweler continued his research and found  that he was missing pins, rings, necklaces, pendant,two pearls, a wrist bracelet, etc..,\nin all for 20,000 francs of jewelry.\nHe noticed Paul Gruault was not the only one guilty of embezzlement.\nA polisher, Widow Riviere, 48, 11 rue Louis-le-Grand, had contributed.\n\nHere's how the two employees infidels:\nwhen the jewelry out to clean the windows, they announced a couple of articles less. They brought out seventeen, for example, and they said there were only fifteen or sixteen.  Their boss believed that the items were also in the store and did not realize the theft.\n\nThe stolen jewels were then pawned or sold.\n\nAfter an investigation by highly skilled police, the two thieves were arrested and yesterday\nthey appeared before Mr. Judge Bouchardon.\nThey both said they had acted in moments of madness.\n\n Paul Gruault said, bursting into tears, I went to the richest young people\nme, I wanted to spend like them, I wanted to shine, I'm unhappy.\n\nPaul Gruault and the widow Riviere committed their flights independently\nfrom each other they were not associated, and their surprise was great to be together at\nthe judge. Gruault stated that since leaving the store, he erred through the streets with the thought of suicide,but courage had failed him.&quot;", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6266479086-72157628017445172", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6266479086"}}
