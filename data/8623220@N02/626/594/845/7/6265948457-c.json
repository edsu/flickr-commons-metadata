Here is some of its history from Engineering News of 1912:\n&quot;Dry Dock No. 4, at the Brooklyn U. S. Navy Yard, has finally been completed after seven years' labor, during which three different contractors have successively taken over the contract. The dock is of concrete construction, 695 ft.long, 139 ft. wide and 31ft. deep, providing dockage for the largest naval vessels now contemplated. The contract for its construction was first let in 1905 to George Spearin, but the immense difficulties in foundation construction, resulting from the soft bottom encountered, caused that firm to abandon the job, and in 1907 it was relet to the Williams Engineering Co. Soon after, when only 15% of the work had been completed, that firm, too, was forced to abandon the contract. It was then thought that the Government would have to continue the work by day labor, but this was decided against and bids were asked for the completion of the work from private companies, plans for its prosecution to be submitted with the bid. Under this arrangement the contract was awarded in October, 1909, to Holbrook, Cabot &amp; Rollins, of Boston, Mass. This firm carried the construction to a successful conclusion, and on May 10, 1912 it was emptied to allow the docking of the 22,000-ton  U. S. battleship &quot;Utah.&quot; The operation proved successful. The original appropriation for the construction was $1,500,000, of which $240,000 was expended in the first two attempts at construction. The final bid was $1,390,000, which was subsequently Increased to $2,750,000.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=YeMRAQAAMAAJ&amp;vq=944&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA945#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Navy%20Yard%22%20Brooklyn&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=YeMRAQAAMAAJ&amp;vq=944&amp;lr&...</a>\nI believe it is the only dry dock at the Brooklyn yard with a round end, and there appear to be many pictures of ships docked in it in the Bain collection.", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6265948457-72157627953574946", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6265948457/#comment72157627958403020", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "31580040@N04", "iconserver": "3187", "datecreate": "1319376694", "_content": "@ Artolog, why bother changing the date, it's LOC's standard sometime between roughly 1910 and 1915 for the entire batch of negatives.", "authorname": "Retired at last", "id": "8602872-6265948457-72157627958403020", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6265948457/#comment72157627961366998", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1319400977", "_content": "Well, I think they actually do change them once they receive enough information.

While 1910 to 1915 is the general date for these negatives, we are glad when people identify more specific dates which provide better context. In this case, the date written on the negative &quot;10/23/14&quot;, closely matches the date of  the New York Times article of 10/26/14 which reports on the painting of the Moreno  at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Thus we can add a location as well as a more specific date to our image description to assist future researchers", "authorname": "Arden (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-6265948457-72157627975639052", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6265948457"}}
