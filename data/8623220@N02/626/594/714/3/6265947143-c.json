These were the rings issued during the Napoleonic wars, a &quot;troublous time,&quot; indeed, and they signified that the wearer had pledged her gold or her jewels in the cause of Germany. \n\nToday over ten thousand in New York City are wearing iron rings engraved with this same inscription.  It has been done so quietly that the public has not realized it.  Yet since the first of September there has been a steady stream of the Germans of this city to a little kodak and phonograph shop far up on Second Avenue.  Here the women have been bringing their jewels, their heirlooms, the men their watches, their musical instruments and money, to receive in return their iron ring.\n\nSee also:\nA biographical sketch about Henry Mielke (including a photo) in <u>Schlegel's German-American families in the United States ..., Volume 2</u>,  By Carl Wilhelm Schlegel, American Historical Society (1917).\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=CnATAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA363&amp;ots=KLH_gnZTk7&amp;dq=mielke phonograph&amp;pg=PA362-IA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=CnATAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA363&amp;...</a>", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "8602872-6265947143-72157627821029245", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6265947143/#comment72157627976069374", "realname": "Arden", "path_alias": "arden_loc", "author": "35072786@N08", "iconserver": "3331", "datecreate": "1319557203", "_content": "TVL 1970:  Thank you for telling us about the interesting context for these two photographs and for providing your sources of the New York Times and the biographical article on Henry Mielke in Schlegel's German-American families which includes a photograph.
