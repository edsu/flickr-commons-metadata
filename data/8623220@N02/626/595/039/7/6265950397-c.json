A more detailed account of it must be given here. The German army had then crossed and taken up positions on the north bank between Compiegne and Soissons and toward Reims. Heavy artillery had been rushed down from the north and placed on various strategic points, notably in the quarries behind Soissons, at Vic-sur-Aisne, and at Attichy. On the right the army was protected by the Forest of l'Aigle and the Oise, which descends almost due south from Noyon. It was an extremely strong position, capable only of frontal attack. It was clear from the outset that these fortified positions must be fought for and taken, no matter how great the effort, how terrible the sacrifice.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q58MAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;ots=IAW2EwBn8d&amp;dq=l'aigle%20forest%20france%20war&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=l'aigle&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=Q58MAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6265950397-72157627957805220", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6265950397/#comment72157627851902409", "realname": "Arden", "path_alias": "arden_loc", "author": "35072786@N08", "iconserver": "3331", "datecreate": "1319562042", "_content": "artolog: I think you are correct that this image shows the For\u00eat de l'Aigle not &quot;Laigle&quot;.
