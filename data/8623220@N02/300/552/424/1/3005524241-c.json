Any vertically plumb lines must line up as parallel lines visually and these do not.  It is possible that both buildings are &quot;leaning&quot; and the apparent amount is a cumulative effect.  The only other possible explanation is that the front planes of one or both of these two buildings are purposely built inclining but that does not seem to be the case. The nearest of those two buildings is composed of a columned front in tiered vertical groupings.\n\nTo the left in the photo the columned buildings facing the circle in a concave front are very impressive.  They remind one of some of the structures of ancient Rome.  But note too, that the nearest of that curved front is lacking a hand and safety rail which is apparently provided further in the distance.\n\nMonument Circle is a very impressive place, except for when in traffic there, one is forced to move along briskly so that viewing the arcitecture is a problem.  It's better to park a distance away and walk to the monument to get the full view.\n\nAs a small boy in the 40's, my father referred to a trip to Indianapolis as going to &quot;the city&quot;.  No other city in Indiana had that recognition.", "authorname": "americanbottoms", "id": "8602872-3005524241-72157610723708526", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3005524241/#comment72157611561801920", "realname": "Kris Arnold", "path_alias": "cangeceiro", "author": "21142159@N05", "iconserver": "3125", "datecreate": "1230052048", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/949650@N20/\">NUVO.net: Indianapolis Photographers</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Kris Arnold Photo", "id": "8602872-3005524241-72157611561801920", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3005524241/#comment72157615779557163", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1237944541", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/591987@N24/\">soulful group</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-3005524241-72157615779557163", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3005524241/#comment72157615779561595", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1237944552", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1050819@N21/\">a new world</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-3005524241-72157615779561595", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3005524241/#comment72157615866909936", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1237944566", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/972473@N24/\">piece of heaven</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-3005524241-72157615866909936", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3005524241/#comment72157615866915972", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1237944575", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/936496@N24/\">THE BEST PHOTOS OF THE WORLD</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-3005524241-72157615866915972", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3005524241/#comment72157617808145780", "realname": "agnis", "path_alias": "agnisflugen", "author": "22435394@N08", "iconserver": "2093", "datecreate": "1241667025", "_content": "neat! i use to work inside the fed ex on the circle, and this was the view from our  window....it's really fascinating to see if from another era......", "authorname": "agnisflugen", "id": "8602872-3005524241-72157617808145780", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3005524241/#comment72157618805485520", "realname": "Ryan Cary", "path_alias": "ryancary", "author": "36665739@N04", "iconserver": "3147", "datecreate": "1243314631", "_content": "Awesome shot!!\nPlease add this great image to :\n[Black and White Beauty's]\n&quot;Black and White Beauty's&quot; Post 1 Award 2", "authorname": "Ryryc181", "id": "8602872-3005524241-72157618805485520", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3005524241/#comment72157622066131877", "realname": "Rob Ketcherside", "path_alias": "tigerzombie", "author": "29056926@N02", "iconserver": "3136", "datecreate": "1251683679", "_content": "NOW:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/tigerzombie/3871984727/]", "authorname": "Rob Ketcherside", "id": "8602872-3005524241-72157622066131877", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3005524241/#comment72157622279900376", "realname": "Rob Ketcherside", "path_alias": "tigerzombie", "author": "29056926@N02", "iconserver": "3136", "datecreate": "1252303714", "_content": "I contacted the Indianapolis HIstorical Society about this photo.
