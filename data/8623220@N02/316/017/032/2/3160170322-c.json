It would be worth looking at period photos of Newark for comparison.  \n\nThe Buick in the foreground has a New York license plate, number 35227 from 1913, and has \u201cOfficial Scout\u201d tarped over the engine.  The vehicle on the right has plate 8515 which appears to say \u201cNJ\u201d in the top right and \u201c13\u201d below it: New Jersey Plates.  The car on the left, 1226, also has a blurry \u201cNJ\u201d with some sort of circular mark and then \u201c13\u201d below it.  The layout matches New Jersey\u2019s porcelain plates from 1913, with red text and a metal seal where the circular mark is.\n\nInformation about this hike is in a number of New York Times and Washington Post articles starting January, 1913.  NYTimes Jan 13, 1913 p22 &quot;18-day March to Capital&quot; describes Jones' announcement of the hike in Philadelphia.  Wa Post Feb 13 1913 p1 \u201cCold Feet in Ranks\u201d describes the zero-degree walk in New Jersey on day one, where the core 16 hikers were accompanied by 184 single dayers.  Wa Post Feb 18 1913 p1 \u201cArmy Escapes Rout\u201d describes the marchers snowballed and stoned by young boys and laughed at by adults near Chester, Pennsylvania \u2013 finally they were escorted by cadets on horseback from the Chester Military College. NY Times Feb 24 1913 p11 \u201cCol. Craft Defiant\u201d describes stragglers' arrival in Baltimore.  Wa Post Feb 24 1913 p1 \u201cTwo Armies Now\u201d describes fourteen of the original sixteen arriving in Baltimore.  Wa Post Feb 25 1913 p2 \u201cPilgrims Not Weary\u201d arranging for Thursday reception at Washington, DC.  Wa Post Feb 27 1913 p1 \u201cRace Barrier is Up\u201d describes the hikers\u2019 plans to disband if they are joined by a group of negro women planning to hike with them into Washington \u2013 also describes cold shoulder given to marchers who attempted to join them at Laurel, Md with a flag \u201cVotes for negro women\u201d. Wa Post Feb 28, 1913 p1 \u201cArmy at City Gates\u201d describes route planned into Washington, and the harsh treatment into Bladensburg, Md \u2013 after being jeered the entire way, at College Park the men with them were forced to fight off angry college students in the heavy rain.\n\nI thought the &quot;Official Scout&quot; car might be the yellow \u201cammunition wagon\u201d described in the Washington Post of Feb 13 as driven by Miss Elizabeth Freeman, the \u201cofficial orator.\u201d  But apparently it was really a wagon, as <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3102890456/\">captured in this other Bain photo</a>.

The group traveled on Frelinghuysen Avenue, Newark Avenue, and then back on Broad Street.  The streetcars in the background would be of the Public Service Railway, running south perhaps to Elizabeth, New Brunswick or Perth Amboy.  The hikers went to Elizabeth and then New Brunswick the first day, February 12, 1913.\n\nWe get conflicting names for the driver of the lead car.
