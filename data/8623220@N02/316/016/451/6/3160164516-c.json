It was designed by architect Samuel Belcher, in what is now called the the Late Georgian style (in England), or the Federal style (in the United States.) In 1841, it became the home of sea captain Robert Griswold. \n\nIn the late 19th century, Captain Griswold's heirs, including his daughter Florence (1850-1937), began taking in boarders.  Among these boarders were several artists, and by the 1910s, the Griswold boarding house, and its proprietor, had become the center of Old Lyme's thriving artist colony.\n\nThe Griswold house has been the Florence Griswold Museum since 1947. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975,  and was declared a national  historic Landmark in 1993. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.flogris.org/index.html\">Florence Griswold Museum  web site</a>.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-3160164516-72157612075009379", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3160164516/#comment72157612199234281", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1231267401", "_content": "whyaduck: Thanks for the information.
