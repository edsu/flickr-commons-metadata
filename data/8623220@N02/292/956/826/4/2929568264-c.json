Though many were communists, others had moved to Soviet Russia as skilled auto workers to help produce cars at the recently-constructed GAZ automobile factory built by the Ford Motor Company. The American workers, suspected by Stalin of being 'poisoned' by Western influences, were dragged off with the others to Lubyanka Prison by the NKVD in the very same Ford Model A cars they had helped build, where they were tortured and either executed or exiled to Soviet gulags. Davies refused to lodge even a mild diplomatic protest, and later commented to the media: 'The Soviet Union is doing wonderful things.  The leaders of the government are an extremely capable, serious, hardworking, and powerful group of men and women.'\u201d", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "8602872-2929568264-72157626665850169", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2929568264"}}
