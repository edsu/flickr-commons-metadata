June, 1912  had hearings as to Harry Thaw's sanity, with Evelyn taking the stand.  This outfit seems appropriate for a court appearance and she's outside a formal building.  See, for example, \nJune 22, 1912, Saturday,\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C00E4DE113AE633A25751C2A9609C946396D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C00E4DE113AE633A...</a>\n\n&quot;EVELYN THAW WON'T TELL THE OLD STORY; Thaw Hid Behind Her Skirts, She Says, &quot;in His Two Dirty Murder Trials,&quot; but Won't Now.&quot;\n\nThere were also sanity hearings in June/July 1915, but Evelyn didn't take the stand after first evading the subpoena and then claiming a nervous breakdown.  After being arrested, she was then excused by the judge.\n\nMeanwhile I notice that a biography was published this year.

"_content": "Evelyn Nesbit, the young woman in the image, was a major celebrity in her day.  She started modeling in her early teens for many prominent artists, went on to become one of the famous &quot;Gibson Girls&quot;, and also launched her own acting career. \n\n At the very young age of 17, she was 'seduced' (today we'd call this rape) by highly-known and influential architect, Stanford White, of the architectural firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White.  For many years thereafter, Nesbit, her mother, and her brother were the beneficiaries of financial support from White.  Nesbit eventually married multi-millionaire, unstable and violent, Harry Thaw.  Thaw had been obsessed for many years with architect S White, believing him to be committed to ruining his (Thaw's) reputation.  When Nesbit revealed to Thaw (who himself had battered and assaulted her on occasions), Thaw became determined to kill S White.  This he did, in public, shooting White in the face with a pistol, in around, I believe, 1910.  Thaw's trial for the murder of White was very big news at the time, and reported extensively in all papers around the country.  \n\nThaw was tried twice; during the first trial, a hung jury resulted, during the second, he was found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity and committed to an institution for the insane (from which he later escaped).  \n\nNesbit was forced to testify at both trials and to repeat lurid and provocative details of her relations (sexual and otherwise) with both men.  After this point, her reputation was irrevocably ruined, and, after being rejected by Thaw's extremely wealthy but cold and bizarre family, she struggled to support herself for the rest of her surprisingly long life:  Nesbit lived until the late 60's.  \n\nHard to believe a life spanning so much change in American society!\n\nHer face should look familiar:  drawings, painting, prints of all kinds were made of her by many artists and designers throughout her youth, and one can still find these frequently reproduced.  One of the most well-known images of her is the profile drawing in black and white of a young, beautiful woman of the times, her hair piled upon her head and trailing down the back of her neck in a manner that resembles a question mark.  This print was entitled, &quot;The Eternal Question&quot;.", "authorname": "pamelanmartin", "id": "8602872-2929579164-72157634680053419", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2929579164/#comment72157635083567189", "realname": "Sue Stinson", "path_alias": null, "author": "100317075@N07", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1376601770", "_content": "The workmanship on this jacket is absolutely amazing.

Are you suggesting that the hat Nesbit wears in the original photo is not authentic, but was somehow photoshopped?  Far more elaborate hats were worn in Nesbit's day.
