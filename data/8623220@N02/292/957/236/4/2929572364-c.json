From <a href=\"http://www.travelpublishing.co.uk/CountyIntros/NorthernIrelandIntro.htm\">www.travelpublishing.co.uk/CountyIntros/NorthernIrelandIn...</a>, &quot;A short detour off the A2 on the B92 leads to the striking little village of Cushendun, once a fashionable watering place and distinguished by its very un-Irish architecture. Most of the buildings were designed by Clough Williams-Ellis, better known for his fantasy village of Portmeirion in Wales. He was commissioned by Ronald McNeill, 1st (and last) Lord Cushendun, and his Cornish wife Maud to create a setting with a Cornish theme. So the houses, built between 1912 and 1925, are of rugged white-washed stone with roofs of slate. Williams-Ellis also designed Lord Cushendun's large neo-Georgian house, fronted by an odd five arch arcade, which is now a home for the elderly. The tiny village, (population about 70), is owned by the National Trust which fussily preserves its pristine appearance. &quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-2929572364-72157608064606269", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2929572364/#comment72157608057899734", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1224105787", "_content": "&quot;A letter from Ronald McNeill, Unionist Member of Parliament for the St. Augustine Division of Kent, to Mrs. Simeon Ford of this city&quot; was published in the NYT on December 5, 1915.
