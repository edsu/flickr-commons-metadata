Pankhurst was sentenced (in London)  to nine months jail on May 22, 1912  &quot;convicted of conspiracy and incitement to commit damage, the charges arising out of the suffragist window-smashing campaign.&quot; See <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B02EEDA153CE633A25750C2A9639C946396D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B02EEDA153CE633A...</a>\n\nPhoto apparently by Matzene of Chicago.  She had been in Chicago in November 1909, according to NYT <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9400E6D81630E733A25755C2A9679D946897D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9400E6D81630E733A...</a>\nShe was there again in November 1913.  \n\n Matzene appears to have registered a photograph in the same outfit <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3b34110\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3b34110</a> for copyright as of  October 25 1913.  Another LoC photo -- <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3b31732\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3b31732</a>  -- is quite specifically a photo from 1909 copyrighted in 1913.  So perhaps that's the case for the Matzene photos -- taken during the 1909 visit but copyrighted at the start of her 1913 visit.  Pankhurst was held at Ellis Island for a day or two (Oct 18-20, 1913) with a deportation order issued, but later rescinded.\n\nAnother picture by Matzene, dated as from the 1913 visit and in a different outfit is <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/mnwp.275016\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/mnwp.275016</a>. \n\nPin/brooch and ribbon are probably of some significance.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-2928712425-72157607992361997", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2928712425/#comment72157608127670613", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1224276717", "_content": "We'll fix the date in the source data and reload the description.
