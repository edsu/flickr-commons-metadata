From the dated pictures in the Bain flow near this one, this scene is likely after the Second Battle of Ypres (there were to be five during the war).  During this battle, Chlorine gas was first used by the Germans, inflicting thousands of deaths.  The town itself was more or less completely destroyed by the end of the war.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres</a>\nThere were more than a hundred thousand dead, wounded or missing in the battle.  In the Third Battle of Ypres there were 450,000 to 800,000 casualties.\nJohn McCrae wrote his famous poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; during this battle.\n\nIn Flanders fields the poppies blow\n   Between the crosses, row on row,\n   That mark our place; and in the sky\n   The larks, still bravely singing, fly\nScarce heard amid the guns below.\n\nWe are the Dead. Short days ago\n   We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\n   Loved and were loved, and now we lie\n         In Flanders fields.\n\nTake up our quarrel with the foe:\nTo you from failing hands we throw\n   The torch; be yours to hold it high.\n   If ye break faith with us who die\nWe shall not sleep, though poppies grow\n         In Flanders fields.", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-8231848635-72157632171449225", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8231848635/#comment72157632209313008", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mambo1935", "author": "79597829@N00", "iconserver": "48", "datecreate": "1355081920", "_content": "grace!", "authorname": "mambo1935", "id": "8602872-8231848635-72157632209313008", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "8231848635"}}
