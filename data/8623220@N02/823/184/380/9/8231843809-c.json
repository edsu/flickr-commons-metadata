Biiss asked the City for permission to post armed guards on the Manhattan Bridge above the plant to prevent bombs being thrown down onto the building.\n<a href=\"http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70612FB3C5D17738DDDAC0A94DF405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70612FB3C5D1773...</a>\nThe building across Plymouth, at the lower right is also extant, though with bricked-up windows and the parapet removed.
