While the term &quot;pernicious anemia&quot; is sometimes also incorrectly used to indicate megaloblastic anemia due to any cause of vitamin B-12 deficiency, its proper usage refers to that caused by atrophic gastritis and parietal cell loss only.\n\nIt is the most common result of adult vitamin B-12 deficiency.[3]", "authorname": "thehouses", "id": "8602872-2615538645-72157606425796005", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2615538645"}}
