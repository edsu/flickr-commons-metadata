Her first husband (a professor at Trinity College) found two doctors to attest that she was insane.  She sued them all for damages, accusing Brenton of using hypnotism to convince her to sign away her liberty.  In June 1914, she won a verdict against Rev. Brenton and one of the doctors (Paul Waterman), and was awarded $4000.\n\nBut Elizabeth Alden Curtis (Brenton) Holman (b 1879--corrected 3/20) wasn't just an aggrieved spouse; she was a writer.  In 1902 she published a version of <i>The Lament of Baba Tahir</i>, a Persian text, under the name Elizabeth Curtis Brenton; in 1912, she and Holman (not yet married) filed for copyright for a play she wrote, based on <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>.  Also in 1912, she published a play called <i>The Norseman</i>.  She also published poetry in the Connecticut Magazine, The Crisis, and other literary periodicals.  In 1900, she's mentioned in a <i>Nation</i> article as an American poet working on a &quot;thoughtful, pure, and even pleasing&quot; version of the Rubaiyat.\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=yAYDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA264&amp;lpg=PA264\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=yAYDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA264&amp;l...</a>\n\nAs &quot;Elizabeth Curtis Brenton,&quot; she had letters that appeared in the New York Times Saturday Review of Books in 1901 and 1905.\n\nShe may have married again after Holman; I find two listings for an &quot;Elizabeth Alden Curtis Tidd&quot; of Connecticut, filing for copyright on plays she wrote in 1929 and 1933.
