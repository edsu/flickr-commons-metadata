There's no one Google recognizes by the name &quot;Chisson,&quot; and he's not listed on any of the A's rosters 1912-1918.  The script at the right side of the photo appears to say &quot;Chrishong&quot; or &quot;Chiesong&quot; or &quot;Chrishoug&quot; or maybe &quot;Chris Long,&quot; but I can't find any of them either.  The only 1914 or 1915 A's players whose names end in &quot;g&quot; are Rube Oldring and Wally Schang, and this guy is neither of them.\n\nEither this is mis-labeled or the guy was a flashy recruit who never actually played.", "authorname": "rjones0856", "id": "8602872-4954229168-72157624759490581", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "4954229168"}}
