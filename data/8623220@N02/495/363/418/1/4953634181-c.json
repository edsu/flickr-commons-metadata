He studied medicine at Munich (M.D., 1870) and for some years was in practice. His appointment to a chair at Berlin (1884) (against the wishes of the medical faculty) was largely due to his successful treatment of Bismarck for obesity. His method was a modified Banting. He retired to private life in Munich in 1905. Schweninger wrote Dem Andenken Bismarcks (1899).", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-4953634181-72157624874195318", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4953634181"}}
