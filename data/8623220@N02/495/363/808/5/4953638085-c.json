I agree this photo is likely from the previous World Series, based on the other photo you linked. We can make a note to that effect, but will retain the date of the negative as well, since that offers information about the use of the photograph.  Mathewson was in the news in February and March of 1914 as he was deciding between continuing with New York or taking a job with the Federal League.", "authorname": "Kristi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-4953638085-72157628514557821", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4953638085"}}
