Curtiss on Keuka Lake, near Hammondsport, New York. The project was underwritten by Rodman Wanamaker, of the Wanamaker department store chain of Philadelphia and New York City, who hoped to claim the $50,000 prize posted by Lord Northcliffe, of the London Daily Mail, for the first airplane flight from England to North America, or from N.A. to England. The &quot;America&quot; had a 72-foot wingspan. The outbreak of World War I in August, 1914, caused the project to be aborted. The first trans-Atlantic airplane flight was made in 1919, using a different aircraft.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4953639243-72157624874372394", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4953639243"}}
