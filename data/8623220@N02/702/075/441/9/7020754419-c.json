The fine old cathedral, with its four square  towers, and, in fact, the whole town, has not served as a target for the heavy artillerists, owing their immunity to the weakness of the fortifications and the consequent fact that the English didn't find it desirable to linger there on their retreat after Mons [Belgium] in the early days of the war.&quot;\n\nLaon owes its current importance to being a main station on one of the trunk lines of communication.\n\nThe article goes on to point out the &quot;new cosmopolitanism&quot; the war has brought. Germans are now firing French ammunition from Belgian cannon on Englishmen, While in the town itself, the shops are all open and busy, German trains arrive on time, and a genuine Munich beer can be bought ... a change from the earlier days in the war of having to pay three bottles of (French) champagne for a half-pound of butter, while three bottles of red wine was the going price for one cigarette.\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-7020754419-72157629696724719", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "7020754419"}}
