Prison records carry him with the rank of 2nd Lt. and Capt., and indicate he was wded. in left arm, and captured 4/3/65, and sent to U.S. hosp., Washington, D.C. Released 6/6/65, age 19.\n\n<a href=\"http://ranger95.com/civil_war/virginia/artillery/rosters/parkers_bat_i_z.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">ranger95.com/civil_war/virginia/artillery/rosters/parkers...</a> has additional info:\nMOORE, WILLIAM SAVAGE - Private. March 14, 1862. Age is given as 18 on muster roll, but Moore was really only 15 or 16 at enlistment. Present-MR #1-2. Discharged by surgeon for disability after his mother had applied for that judgment. The surgeon found nothing to justify a disability discharge other than the mother's unsupported statement that young Moore was subject to frequent attacks of Diarrhea and her claim that &quot;he is in Every respect unfit to do Military duty.&quot; The surgeon denied this claim, but did find evidence that the boy was only 16 that May and had enlisted without his mother's consent. There was also some difficulty with papers signed by a long-missing husband. (S.O. 289, 12/10/62, AIGO and S.O. 242, 10/16/62, AIGO). There is a note in VSL which says Moore transferred to &quot;1st Howitzer 1863.&quot; This is borne out by the listing of &quot;W. S. Moore&quot; in the roster of the First Company, Richmond Howitzers.\nInterestingly, the same page has:\nMOORE, JOHN C. - Private. March 14, 1862. Age is listed as 18 on the mustering document, but Moore was actually 16 in May, 1862. Present-MR #1-2. Discharged by a surgeon for disability, Oct. 8, 1862, although in effect the discharge was for being under age, and enlisting without parental consent. (S.O. 236, AIGO). Note the almost precisely parallel case of William Savage Moore. The two Moores were quite surely related, possibly even twins, although CSR gives no indications along that line.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-7029387489-72157629340460322", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7029387489/#comment72157629705366899", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1333160850", "_content": "See also:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6883282606/\"><img src=\"http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6040/6883282606_bdfa0018b7_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"139\" alt=\"[Private William Savage Moore of Richmond &quot;Parker&quot; Virginia Light Artillery Battery, 1st Company Howitzers Virginia Light Artillery Battery, and I Company, 15th Virginia Infantry Regiment and lock of hair in case] (LOC)\" /></a>", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-7029387489-72157629705366899", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7029387489/#comment72157629755668529", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1333745920", "_content": "Thanks for connecting the two, swanq. They are definitely brothers. My first thought was that William was on the right in double portrait. But the hair in this image is parted differently, and longer, more like the brother on the left. What do you think?\nP.S. I apologize for not reading your research related to the brothers before responding.  I had thought that it would be useful to identify William in the double portrait even without the name of his brother.
