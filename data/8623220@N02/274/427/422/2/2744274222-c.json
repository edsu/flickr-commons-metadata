That's not the sort of thing bouncing around in my head.\n\n I have seen the date of the funeral/procession vary across the August 27/28/29 including in some online archived newspaper accounts published here in Australia - so I'm not 100% certain.\n\nHere's an example published in Australia one month after the event:\n\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5339166\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5339166</a>\n\nI would like to check the Times of London report, which would probably be authoritative but it's behind a paywall. \n\nAs one would expect of such a significant figure there are several published biographies and I can tell from limited previews and snippets at Google Books that some have extensive accounts of these events - but I could not come up with a conclusive, authoritative date because I could not read the full texts.\n\nAn example of misdating appears in the otherwise excellent National Library of France which carries a photograph showing a similar scene  to that above, dated 31-8-12 :\n\n<a href=\"http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b6921189t.item.r=william+booth.f1.langEN\" rel=\"nofollow\">gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b6921189t.item.r=william+bo...</a>", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "8602872-2744274222-72157624835605391", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2744274222"}}
