Her signature roles included Fiora in L'amore dei tre re, Mimi in La Boheme, Nedda in Pagliacci, and the title roles in Isabeau, Madama Butterfly, and Tosca. After her singing career ended, she embarked on a second career as a voice teacher. Among her notable pupils was opera singer Shirley Verrett.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Fitziu\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Fitziu</a>\n\nShe is probably seen here in connection with her role in  the world premiere of Enrique Granados's Goyescas at the Metropolitan Opera on January 28, 1916.  A number of photos of others connected with that production are in the Bain collection near to this one.\n<a href=\"http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=BibSpeed/fullcit.w?xCID=61870\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/scripts/cgiip.exe/WS...</a>\nSee also\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5694133312/\" title=\"Anna Fitziu  (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5146/5694133312_104f2344c9_m.jpg\" width=\"174\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Anna Fitziu  (LOC)\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9574724873/\" title=\"E.

This brought Miss Fitziu into the limelight, and now it is announced that Gatti-Casazza, who manages the .Metropolitan Opera company, has been converted to the way of thinking of Miss Fitziu's fighting friend, and has given her the role previously played by Lucretia Bori, the Spanish prima donna, in the Spanish opera Goyescas.&quot;\n\nFollowing this story up, I find in The Washington Times., November 20, 1915, HOME EDITION, page 3\n  <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/1915-11-20/ed-1/seq-3/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/1915-11-20/ed-...</a>\n&quot;-Anna Fitziu, who used to be well known as Anna Fitzhugh In the &quot;Wizard of Oz,&quot; but who Is singing more pretentious music now, gave a musicale at the Hotel Biltmore.\n  Two of the audience who sat side by side to hear her were William Thorner, a music teacher, and Andra de Segurola of the Metropolitan Opera House forces.\n  As Thorner had trained Miss Fitziu's voice since she left musical comedy he felt that he had a right to criticize her singing. He turned to Segurola and said: &quot;Too bad, too bad. She's not In good voice today, and anyhow she has made a poor selection of songs.&quot; '\n  Segurola, who is said to have a great personal Interest ln Miss Fltziu. objected strongly, saying that Thorner had no right to utter such criticisms,\n  One word led to another, and the smart audience suddenly saw Thorner jump to his feet and pump rlght and left rapidly Into Segurola's face. The opera singer clinched, and the two men thrashed around the room. Then Mlss Kitziu ran to them and managed to quell the battle. She soothed Begurola's injured face, for the singer's eye was badly swollen.\n  Later ln the day the quarrel between the two men was patched up.\n  When Miss Kltzlu was playing In &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; at the Park Theater it was reported that she was engaged to Dave Montgomery of Montgomery and Stone. One of her most ardent admirers at the time was E.R. Thomas, who gave a dinner in her honor et the Hotel Ansonia which made the guests gasp over the elaborate menu and the handsome favors.&quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-9684140109-72157635468294156", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9684140109/#comment72157635461280813", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1378818797", "_content": "I wonder if the photo on the table is of Segurola.\nThe Bismarck tribune., November 30, 1920, page 5\n  <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042243/1920-11-30/ed-1/seq-5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042243/1920-11-30/ed-...</a>\nreports that Fitziu and Segurola were to be married after a five-year romance.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-9684140109-72157635461280813", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9684140109/#comment72157635471978110", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1378836020", "_content": "I wondered about that too, but the picture is very blurry, even at the highest resolution.", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-9684140109-72157635471978110", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9684140109/#comment72157635624862435", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1379530775", "_content": "All: Thank you for the research on Fitiziu.
