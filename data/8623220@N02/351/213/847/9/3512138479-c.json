Pineze:\n\nIt is a little strange, but it turns out that 'Minas Geraes' was the spelling used at the time the ship was commissioned.  Many references to that spelling can be found in newspapers of the time, and in other sources.  The modern spelling is Gerais, as you pointed out, but Geraes is correct when referring to this ship. \n\n<a href=\"http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=104754131&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=45714&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is one example article about the Minas Geraes</a>  from the New  York Times in 1908. \n\nThanks for your comment!", "authorname": "Kristi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-3512138479-72157624769563962", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3512138479/#comment72157624645723737", "realname": "Reges Pineze", "path_alias": "pineze", "author": "50859936@N03", "iconserver": "4036", "datecreate": "1282353276", "_content": "Yah... i can imagine the spelling and &quot;Geraes&quot; make sense.
