He was at one time recognized by London's National Sporting Club as the world bantamweight champion (Coulon had wider recognition).  In 1913, at the age of 20, Ledoux lost a decision to Campi for the vacant bantamweight title of the old IBU and less than a month later he was beaten by Williams, who claimed the world title; Williams would go on to beat Campi and Coulon as well to cement his claim.  Ledoux would have to wait a long time for another shot at the bantamweight title.  At the age of 32 and nearing the end of his years in the ring, Ledoux challenged world champion <a href=\"http://cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/goldstein-a.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Abe Goldstein</a> and lost a 15-round decision.
