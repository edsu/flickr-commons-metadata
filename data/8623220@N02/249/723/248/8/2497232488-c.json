The date of the NY Times article agrees with the dates of the battle given in the Wikipedia article linked. (This is a different NY Times article than the one linked in my comment above, but by the same correspondent, Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett--<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Ashmead-Bartlett\">Wikipedia article</a>.) Bartlett mentions a &quot;young English photographer named Gordon&quot;, I wonder if he could have been the one to take this photo? Of course it seems that war was well-covered, I also see that the American photojournalist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Hare\">Jimmy Hare</a> covered it.\nSeems like the place and date of this photo are relatively well-established, between 30 October and 3 November 1912, near Sakizkoy, Turkey.
