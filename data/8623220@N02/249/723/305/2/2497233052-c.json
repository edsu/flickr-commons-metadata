One year I got to be the doll that came out of the large pink box and got carried around the arena on Santa's shoulder.  A favorite moment of the pageant would be the roar of the crowd when that majestic large Christmas tree would light up during the Ornaments Dance....wait.. the best moment of the pageant was The spirit of Christmas when Ms. Jorgensen would dance with the few special little fairy dancers and then the large doors would open to reveal hundreds of darling little skipping fairies...I'm tearing up right now just thinking about it. Beautiful Memories for all those who experienced the joy of Ms. Jorgensen and her beloved pageant.
