Charles Becker was eventually executed.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.oldandsold.com/articles01/article929.shtml\">www.oldandsold.com/articles01/article929.shtml</a>\n\n&quot;The police had no trouble getting track of the car with plate number NY 41313, in which the four men who shot Rosenthal got away. It was from a garage that rented out chauffeured cars. Driver Willie Shapiro was soon picked up. Close-lipped at first, Shapiro only admitted that he and the car had been hired for the night of July 15 by gambler Baldy Jack Rose.\n\nBaldy Jack, whose real name was Jacob Rosenzweig, was a crafty character and a handy man with cards. It later evolved that he was a stool pigeon as well as collector of graft for Lieutenant Becker, receiving 25 per cent as part of &quot;The System.&quot; Baldy Jack testified in time that he had helped Becker grab $600,000 in under a year. He was also affiliated with Rosenthal and owned a part interest in the house at 104 West Forty-fifth.\n\nThe two men who started out in the car with Baldy Jack turned out to be Sam Schepps and Harry Vallon. [...]\n\nHarry Vallon was Man Friday to Bridgie Webber, who owned a poker room at the northwest corner of Forty-second Street and Sixth Avenue, a notorious and crooked trap frequented by Becker and never raided. He was also Webber's partner in various stuss houses (stuss was a simplified version of faro, known on New York's East Side as Jewish faro).\n\nThese three men told Shapiro to take them to Seventh Avenue and 145th Street, where they picked up Frank Cirofici, known as Dago Frank, small, hard, and poisonous in a deceptively quiet way, who was a stick-up man and gunman. He was often seen in company of Kid Benson, a big-time Harlem gambler he frequently protected, and his gun was also at the disposal of Big Jake Zelig's East Side gang.&quot;\n\nAccording to this article, Vallon came into the police station to deny being involved in the killing. He spent some time in jail, and at one point Becker clamed Vallon had pulled the trigger, but in the end four other men were convicted of the murder, and Becker of hiring them.", "authorname": "robbed", "id": "8602872-2868839232-72157607372710900", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2868839232/#comment72157607383210239", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1221867878", "_content": "See <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2850362519/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2850362519/</a>", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-2868839232-72157607383210239", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2868839232/#comment72157607424084327", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11572312@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1222055097", "_content": "This was quite a sensational case and there are many photos on LOC Flickr related to it.
