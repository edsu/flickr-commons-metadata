Glenn Curtiss tested his flying boats on Lake Keuka, one of the Finger Lakes in upstate New York. He lived in Hammondsport, at the south end of the lake. \n\nHis first flying boat, the Model E, or Flying Fish, was built in 1912, and is depicted in the photo on <a href=\"http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Aerospace/Curtiss/Aero2G4.htm\">this page</a> at the website of the U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission. I'd say it's the same plane in this Bain photo. <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9406E2D6133CE633A25750C2A9679D946396D6CF\">This New York Times article</a> of November 23, 1912, describes the test of the craft the previous day.\n\nThe flying boat in the Bain photo to which I linked in my first paragraph above has a slightly different design&mdash;especially noticeable in the tail&mdash;and I suspect it may be Curtiss's second such craft, the America, built in 1914.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-2679863564-72157606268353191", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2679863564/#comment72157606333826213", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1216826339", "_content": "whyaduck: Thanks for this information.
