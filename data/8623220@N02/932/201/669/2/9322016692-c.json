Soon, he was invited to Greece to resolve the political deadlock and became the country's Prime Minister. \nNot only did he initiate constitutional and economic reforms that set the basis for the modernization of Greek society, but also reorganized both army and navy in preparation of future conflicts. Before the Balkan Wars of 1912\u20131913, Venizelos' catalytic role helped gain Greece entrance to the Balkan League, an alliance of the Balkan states against Ottoman Turkey. \nThrough his diplomatic acumen, Greece doubled her area and population with the liberation of Macedonia, Epirus, and the rest of the Aegean islands.", "authorname": "littledoggie011", "id": "8602872-9322016692-72157638197699156", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9322016692/#comment72157638198259653", "realname": "", "path_alias": "familyphotos0808", "author": "101061019@N05", "iconserver": "2821", "datecreate": "1385787598", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleftherios_Venizelos\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleftherios_Venizelos</a>", "authorname": "littledoggie011", "id": "8602872-9322016692-72157638198259653", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "9322016692"}}
