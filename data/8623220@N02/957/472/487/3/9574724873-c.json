There was ecstatic applause after each of the first two tableaux and more at the end of the opera. The singers were again and again recalled. Mr. Granados came frequently; Mr. Periquet came; Messrs. Setti, Spech and Bavagnoli came, and none was left unhonored. Vast wreaths were given the two authors of the opera, a bronze one to Mr. Granados. The applause on this occasion doubtless had much of the fictitious value of first-night applause, to which was added the element of national pride. But there seemed to be evidence to show that the brilliantly exotic little opera-it lasts hardly an hour-had really made an impression an the general public, and that it may turn out to have more than the transitory attraction of many new additions to the operatic list.&quot;\n\nSee notes under <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9577520148/\" title=\"E.
