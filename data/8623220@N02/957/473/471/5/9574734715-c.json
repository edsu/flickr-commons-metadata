Here's an account of Cowdin's life with more information about the importance of the event pictured here:\n\n&quot;In December of 1915 Cowdin and fellow countrymen Norman Prince and William Thaw were granted a month's permission to America. They arrived in New York on 23 December aboard the SS Rotterdam. Their furlough, though intended as &quot;a short rest&quot;, furthered the cause for an American squadron when the Government of France realized the interest the three American volunteers had created during their visit to the United States. The pilots became the focus of the eastern press who doggedly pursued them in spite of their reluctance to speak of their duties. Both sides of the European War seized upon the press coverage: the Allied supporters citing the flyers' example in a plea for America's intervention, while German sympathizers condemned their participation as a violation of U.S. neutrality and demanded their internment. Upon their return to France, the three Americans' desire to form an all-American squadron was enhanced as the French Government realized that just such an organization would be useful in galvanizing America's sympathy for their cause.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://rdisa.pagesperso-orange.fr/html/Pages/Elliot%20Cowdin%20EN.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">rdisa.pagesperso-orange.fr/html/Pages/Elliot%20Cowdin%20E...</a>\n\n\nSee also:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9574733941/\" title=\"E.
