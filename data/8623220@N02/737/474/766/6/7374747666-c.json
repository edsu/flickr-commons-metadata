It was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, originally, and later in nearby Eddystone, Pennsylvania. Although the company was very successful as a producer of steam locomotives, its transition to the production of diesels was far less so. Later, when the early demand for diesel locomotives to replace steam tapered off, Baldwin could not compete in the marketplace. It stopped producing locomotives in 1956 and went out of business in 1972.&quot;", "authorname": "bior", "id": "8602872-7374747666-72157630071915579", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7374747666/#comment72157630192388990", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pete_loc", "author": "34911459@N08", "iconserver": "3094", "datecreate": "1340112278", "_content": "bior: thanks for the background information.
