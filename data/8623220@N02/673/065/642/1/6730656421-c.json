The Przemy\u015bl fortress fulfilled its mission very effectively, helping to stop a 300,000 strong Russian army advancing upon the Carpathian Passes and Krak\u00f3w, the Lesser Poland regional capital. The first siege was lifted by a temporary Austro-Hungarian advance. However, the Russian army resumed its advance and initiated a second siege of the fortress of Przemy\u015bl in October, 1914. This time relief attempts were unsuccessful. Due to lack of food and exhaustion of its defenders, the fortress surrendered on March 22, 1915. The Russians captured 126,000 prisoners and 700 big guns. Before surrender, the complete destruction of all fortifications was carried out.&quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-6730656421-72157628961275827", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6730656421/#comment72157628970728283", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1327175939", "_content": "Another Bain photo from the same series, taken at Przemy\u015bl:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6730655497/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7175/6730655497_180a5b158c_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"175\" alt=\"Karl Franz Josef at Przemysl (LOC)\" /></a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6730656421-72157628970728283", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6730656421/#comment72157628998413749", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pete_loc", "author": "34911459@N08", "iconserver": "3094", "datecreate": "1327334762", "_content": "Thanks for the background information.
