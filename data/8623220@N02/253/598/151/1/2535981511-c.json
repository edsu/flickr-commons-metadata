Westcott</b> planned to run for Senate (from New Jersey) in 1912, with apparent backing of newly elected  NJ Gov <b>Woodrow Wilson</b>, according to NYTimes articles from 1912.  This was before the Constitution was amended to provide for direct election of Senators, and at that time the State legislature picked the Senators.  There was some political intrigue involving former NJ Sen. Smith a &quot;boss&quot; who was trying to return to the Senate by cashing in his political IOUs.  Wilson opposed Smith (who had supported Wilson) as an early sign of Wilson's agenda of reform and sweeping out bosses, even Dem bosses.  Ultimately <b>James Martine</b> got the Dem nomination and was elected Senator from NJ instead of either Smith or Westcott.      \n\nJune 28, 1912, Judge Westcott gives a rousing speech in nominating Woodrow Wilson for President at the Democratic convention in Baltimore.\n\nWestcott shows up as being Attorney General for New Jersey and then trying again to run for Senate to replace Sen Martine.  He did not get the Dem nomination and then Martine was defeated by Republican Freylinghuysen in 1916", "authorname": "Harry Angstrom", "id": "8602872-2535981511-72157605347936185", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2535981511/#comment72157619165054623", "realname": "", "path_alias": "bgzimmer", "author": "9375838@N04", "iconserver": "7309", "datecreate": "1244142282", "_content": "His name is properly spelled Wescott, not Westcott.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nj.gov/lps/oag/ag_1914-1919_wescott_bio.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nj.gov/lps/oag/ag_1914-1919_wescott_bio.htm</a>", "authorname": "bgzimmer", "id": "8602872-2535981511-72157619165054623", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2535981511/#comment72157619279123040", "realname": "Mary", "path_alias": "mary_loc", "author": "35122993@N08", "iconserver": "3343", "datecreate": "1244206015", "_content": "bgzimmer: thanks for spotting the spelling error.
