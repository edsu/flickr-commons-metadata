The funnel colors would have been black on top, a red band with white diamond in the middle, and buff colored on the bottom. \n\nI believe the name of the ship is actually the &quot;Santa Marta&quot;, not the Santa Maria. Santa Marta is a coastal town in Colombia and was a place of export for bananas. It's definitely pictured in New York, because you can see the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. These ships were painted white to keep the cargo cooler, and they also carried some passengers.", "authorname": "Mr. T in DC", "id": "8602872-2536793340-72157605339144640", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2536793340/#comment72157605344001022", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mr_t_in_dc", "author": "7471115@N08", "iconserver": "5343", "datecreate": "1212202922", "_content": "More on Santa Marta, from &quot;Going Bananas: 100 Years of American Fruit Ships in the Caribbean&quot; by Mark H.
