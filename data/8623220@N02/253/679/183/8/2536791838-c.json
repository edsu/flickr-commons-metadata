Noyes as Liberty. Everybody must be relying on the misleading Bain caption.\n\nThe LOC does have a decent <a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/service/pnp/ggbain/12500/12520v.jpg\">photo of Florence Fleming Noyes</a>, but the photo with Hedwig Reichert isn't big enough, even in its TIFF version, to be able to make a comparison between the picture of Ms. Noyes and the background figures in the Reichert photo to determine if she is among them.\n\nThe LOC also has another photo of Frances Noyes, but it is in the Arnold Genthe collection which has not been made available online in large versions. From the thumbnail (use the terms &quot;Noyes, Miss&quot; on the Prints &amp; Photographs <a href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pp/mdbquery.html\">search page</a>), it appears to be the same woman at the wheel of the car in the photo above, though somewhat gussied up. \n\nIt occurs to me that, since Frances Noyes served as an ambulance driver during WWI (her first published book was about her war experiences- available for download in several formats <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/myaefhailfarewel00hart\">here</a> at the Internet Archive),  the photo above may depict her at about that time- perhaps 1917-1918.
