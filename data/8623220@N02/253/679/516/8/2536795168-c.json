Running in lanes through a curve suggests either a 200m or 400m, but this is most likely the 400m. The background is where the present day finish line is (and I believe where it was in 1912 as well), and the relatively even stagger among the runners again suggests that this just after the start of the 400. There are five runners in the field. Assuming that this is the final, that also points to the 400 since there were five runners in the 400m final, and six in the 200m. From the results of the 400m final, the runners, from right (lane 1) to left (lane 5):\n\n1. Ted Meredith (USA)\n2. Hanns Braun (GER) \n3. Charles Reidpath (USA)\n4. Carroll Haff (USA)\n5. Edward Lindberg (USA)\n\nThe uniforms that are clearly visible match that lineup.\n\nEdited to add source: bottom of page 64, Olympic Track &amp; Field statistics book, published by IAAF (International governing body for T&amp;F).
