According to the Phildelphia Public Ledger (Feb. 25, 1915) Roy Shattuck pleaded not guilty to charges that he conspired with other unsuccessful candidates to corrupt the elections. The Baltimore Sun (April 13, 1915) reported that some those accused of corruption received prison sentences, but some were given suspended sentences as they had agreed to testify in the trial of Roy Shattuck.  The Ogden (Utah) Standard (Nov. 30, 1915) reports four of the indicted who were going to testify against Shattuck in his trial, had now received their jail sentences because &quot;Shattuck since has died&quot;.", "authorname": "Arden (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-5642866167-72157626450386857", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5642866167"}}
