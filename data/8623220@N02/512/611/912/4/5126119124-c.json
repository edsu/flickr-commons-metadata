After a concert career, she appeared at the Savoy Theatre in the first repertory seasons of Gilbert and Sullivan operas mounted by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1906-09, under the direction of the author. She is remembered as one of the last principal sopranos personally trained by W. S. Gilbert at the Savoy. In between engagements with D'Oyly Carte, Dow performed in concerts and operetta. After her retirement from the professional stage, she directed amateur productions of the Savoy Operas until she was in her seventies.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Dow\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Dow</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-5126119124-72157625144971625", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5126119124/#comment72157625145450041", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "91829349@N00", "iconserver": "5466", "datecreate": "1288410043", "_content": "The caption says &quot;<u>Cora</u> Dow&quot; -- pharmacist and philanthropist.
