Cruce's Daughter, Half-Indian, Names the Fighting Oklahoma</b>\nNew York Times \nCAMDEN, N.J., March 23. -- &quot;I christen thee Oklahoma,&quot; cried Miss Miss Lorena Jane Cruce, daughter of Gov. Cruce of the new western State, and as the bottle of champagne crashed smartly on the prow of the superdreadnought the cheers of patriotic Oklahomans vied with the whistles of tugs at the yards of the New York Shipbuilding Company. \n\n<b>NOTE</b> - If you read the full story at the link above, you will read that also present at the ill-fated USS Oklahoma's launching was &quot;Assistant Secretary Roosevelt,&quot; that is Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Over 27 years later, USS Oklahoma would be sunk in the Japanese sneak-attack on Pearl Harbor, a day that the later-President Franklin D. Roosevelt would describe as a day which would &quot;live in infamy.&quot;", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "8602872-5125515257-72157625144544037", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5125515257/#comment72157625270140174", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11418107@N02", "iconserver": "1068", "datecreate": "1288407493", "_content": "Lorena Jane Cruce (1895-1972), b.
