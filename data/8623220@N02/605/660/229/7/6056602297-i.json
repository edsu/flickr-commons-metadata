After three and a half months of incessant maneuvering and much hard fighting, Sherman forced Hood to abandon the munitions center of the Confederacy.  Sherman remained there, resting his war-worn men and accumulating supplies, for nearly two and a half months.  During the occupation, George N. Barnard, official photographer of the Chief Engineer's Office, made the best documentary record of the war in the West; but much of what he photographed was destroyed in the fire that spread from the military facilities  blown up at Sherman's departure on November 15.\nForms part of Selected Civil War photographs, 1861-1865 (Library of Congress)\n\n<b>Subjects:\n</b> Forts &amp; fortifications.\nPhotography.\nAtlanta Campaign, 1864,\nUnited States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Military facilities.\nUnited States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Communications.\nUnited States--Georgia--Atlanta.\n\n<b>Format: </b> Stereographs--1860-1870.\nWet collodion negatives.\n\n<b>Rights Info: </b> No known restrictions on publication.\n\n<b>Repository: </b> Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA, <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/pp.print\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/pp.print</a>\n\n<b>Part Of: </b> Selected Civil War photographs, 1861-1865 (Library of Congress) (DLC)   94837675\n\n<b>Persistent URL: </b> <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cwpb.02243\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cwpb.02243</a>\n\n<b>Call Number: </b> LC-B811- 2724\n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3344", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1864-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1347893915", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1313698154"}, "originalsecret": "164ce66c46", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6190", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6056602297/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
