Milhollen and Donald H. Mugridge, Washington, D.C. : Library of Congress, 1977. No. 0687\nPhotograph of the War in the West. These photographs are of the Siege of Knoxville, November-December 1863. The difficult strategic situation of the Federal armies after Chicamauga enabled Bragg to detach a force under Longstreet which aimed to drive Burnside out of East Tennessee and did shut him up in Knoxville, which he defended successfully.  These views, taken after Longstreet's withdrawal on December 3, include one of Strawberry Plains, which was on his line of retreat.  Here we have part of an army record; Barnard was photographer of the chief engineer's office, Military Division of the Mississippi, and his views were transmitted with the report of the chief engineer of Burnside's army, April 11, 1864.\nForms part of Selected Civil War photographs, 1861-1865 (Library of Congress)\n\n<b>Subjects:\n</b> Bridges.\nPhotography.\nUnited States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Transportation.\nUnited States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Communications.\nUnited States--Tennessee--Knoxville.\n\n<b>Format: </b> Stereographs--1860-1870.\nWet collodion negatives.\n\n<b>Rights Info: </b> No known restrictions on publication.\n\n<b>Repository: </b> Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA, <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/pp.print\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/pp.print</a>\n\n<b>Part Of: </b> Selected Civil War photographs, 1861-1865 (Library of Congress) (DLC)   94837675\n\n<b>Persistent URL: </b> <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cwpb.02139\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cwpb.02139</a>\n\n<b>Call Number: </b> LC-B811- 2665\n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3598", "farm": 7, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1864-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1377161172", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1313698150"}, "originalsecret": "379093da3b", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "6088", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6056602079/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
