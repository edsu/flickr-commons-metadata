He was seen in most of his photographs dressed as a Death's Head Hussar, and caricaturists generally drew him in that uniform, which suited his long and lanky fignre. At eighteen he &quot;came of age&quot; and assumed the Royal and Imperial dignities and precedence, and in the same year (1900) was made a Lieutenant in the 1st Foot Guards, served three years in that rank, became a Cavalry Captain for four years, and a Major for six. His name appeared on the lists of eleven or twelve different German regiments, and he also belonged to the llth Spanish Dragoons. Up to the outbreak of the Great War he could be described as a keen regimental soldier up to a certain point. He was advanced to the command of the Death's Head Hussars at Danzig. Without any real knowledge of war he was quickly jumped up in rank from commander of a cavalry regiment to lieutenantgeneral, and given command of the largest group of army-corps.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/totenkopf.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/totenkopf.htm</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6851812745-72157629331374199", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6851812745"}}
