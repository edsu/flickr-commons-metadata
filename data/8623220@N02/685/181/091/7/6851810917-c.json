Runkel</b> (1890-1936) and <b>Oscar F. Grab</b> (1886\u20131958) were married on March 23, 1915, at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in New York City. \n\nClaire was the daughter of Herman Runkel (1853-1918) and Victoria Rebecca Runkel (n\u00e9e Lopez) (1859-1927), of 150 W. 79th Street in New York City. Mr. Runkel was of the firm Runkel Brothers, chocolate manufacturers.\n\n&quot;Oscar F. Grab , born Oskar Grab, was an Austro-Hungarian immigrant, United States citizen, and fashion executive. He was a saloon passenger aboard <i>Lusitania</i> who saw the torpedo impact the ship on May 7, 1915.. He saw lifeboats upset on the starboard side and jumped into the water instead of taking a chance in the lifeboats. He was rescued and survived the Lusitania disaster.&quot; His wife was not traveling with him.\n\n&quot;Oscar and Claire moved in with Claire\u2019s parents that October. The couple had two children, Victoria, born in 1916, and Donald born in 1923.
