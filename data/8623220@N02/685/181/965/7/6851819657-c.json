It was divided among the Russian, German (Prussian), and Austrian Empires.  These divisions were known as Partitions.  \nRussian-Poland \nRussia had obtained White Russia and Latvian Lithuania to the Dnieper and Dvina rivers in the First Partition of Poland.  In the Second Partition, Russia took most of the western Ukraine, including Podolia and a part of Volhynia, and all of the eastern part of Lithuania, also obtaining the right to move its troops into what remained of Poland and control its foreign policy.  Russia acquired the rest of Lithuania and the Ukraine, the remainder of Volhynia, and the Duchy of Courland in the Third Partition. \n\nWarsaw and the surrounding area were under Prussian rule until 1815, when the Congress Kingdom of Poland comes into being under Russian rule.  The former provinces of Grodno, Kalicz, Kielce, Lublin, Lodz, Lomza, Plock, Radom, Siedlce, and Suwalki were among those areas annexed by the Russian Government.&quot;\n\nHere is a map of &quot;Russian Poland&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.feefhs.org/maplibrary/russian/re-polan.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.feefhs.org/maplibrary/russian/re-polan.html</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6851819657-72157629336040229", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6851819657/#comment72157629342493935", "realname": "", "path_alias": "yenndza", "author": "7670629@N03", "iconserver": "1", "datecreate": "1329394943", "_content": "i know:) i'm Polish:)\nthe expression &quot;Russian Poland&quot; rises hair on my back:)\nThank You for this explanation.", "authorname": "oaza_spokoju", "id": "8602872-6851819657-72157629342493935", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6851819657/#comment72157629344484029", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1329406416", "_content": "Poland's neighbors used to find its borders very &quot;flexible&quot; until relatively recently, eh?", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6851819657-72157629344484029", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6851819657/#comment72157629345435405", "realname": "", "path_alias": "yenndza", "author": "7670629@N03", "iconserver": "1", "datecreate": "1329411295", "_content": "it's a country between two big nations: Germans and Russians. \n&quot;God's Playgroud&quot; - a book by Norman Davies\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God%27s_Playground\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God%27s_Playground</a>\n\nWe still consider Bialorus and Ukraine and some of Lithuania as our lands.\nThey where taken from us after WW II by the USSR and we took some land from Germans.\nBorders of Poland where very flexible", "authorname": "oaza_spokoju", "id": "8602872-6851819657-72157629345435405", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6851819657/#comment72157629345566373", "realname": "", "path_alias": "yenndza", "author": "7670629@N03", "iconserver": "1", "datecreate": "1329411960", "_content": "of course, the Belorussians, Ukrainians and Lithuanians think differently  and we are not questioning that they have the lands of their own.", "authorname": "oaza_spokoju", "id": "8602872-6851819657-72157629345566373", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6851819657/#comment72157629349276761", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1329431043", "_content": "Poland had Austria-Hungary chewing on it from the south, too.
