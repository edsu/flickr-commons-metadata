Tener and his wife, and for providing the date from the side of the negative. \n\nIt turns out this is one of those cases we find where the date on the negative is not the same as the date of the event shown. This is Gov. Tener and wife Harriet at Game 2 of the 1913 World Series between the Philadelphia Athletics and New York Giants, which took place on Oct. 8, 1913, rather than Oct. 9, 1913 as noted on the negative.
