Mr. Flanner on the far right is reading a 1913 souvenir score book issued by the Athletics for the World Series, so that further confirms the date.  The full date is likely 10/8/13 despite the 10/9/13 on the negative. Game 2 of the 1913 World Series took place at Shibe Park in Philadelphia on Oct. 8, while Game 3 took place the next day in Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds. \n\nThanks for the heads up!", "authorname": "Kristi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-4370903540-72157623425416611", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4370903540"}}
