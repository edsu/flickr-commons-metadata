They did throw the ball in the backfield, mostly laterals.  The ball back then was a bit rounder and harder to pass compared to the modern day ball.  Football was more a running game, more like rugby.  I wish there were more old movies to watch of football.  Most of the films I have seen are very brief and from a distance.  They had some interesting film strips of Jim Thorpe playing around 1915 on a recent special about him.  I can't recall if that was on PBS or on the History Channel.  I think it is incredible that the Carlisle Indian School could beat powerful teams like Army.  Carlisle Indian School was not even a college.  There is no question in my mind that Jim Thorpe was the most talented athlete of all time.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle_Indian_Industrial_School\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle_Indian_Industrial_School</a>\n\nHere is something I found on the forward pass.
