The caption on that photo says:\r\n&quot;Off New York City, during the October 1912 Naval Review.&quot;\r\nThat sounds like the date for this series of photos, perhaps.\r\nWhy the number 9? Perhaps it is misidentified, but if so, it would seem the photo at the Naval Historical Center is as well.\r\n\r\nNote that <a href=\"http://www.navsource.org/archives/01/012714.jpg\">this photo</a> (linked from <a href=\"http://www.navsource.org/archives/01/27.htm\">this page</a>) shows <i>Michigan</i> (BB-27) at the October 1912 review in New York, and <i>Michigan</i> has a banner with the number 17. (So the banner does not appear to correspond to the ship's designation.) Perhaps the banner was some particular number for the event, keyed to a program or something like that?\r\n\r\nNote added: The Wikipedia article on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Review\">Naval Review</a> gives details of the event:\r\n&quot;14 October 1912, North River, ships including USS Delaware (BB-28) and USS E-1 (SS-24) passed before the President (Taft) and the Secretary of the Navy George von L. Meyer.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe date is also given as 14 October 1912 in this article from the <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0CE3D91730E733A25753C2A9649C946596D6CF\">New York Times</a>, February 19, 1914.", "authorname": "cotinis", "id": "8602872-2349133889-72157604200165639", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2349133889/#comment72157607138626377", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "22968943@N05", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1220683751", "_content": "This list:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/scs028a/1912List.html\">www.geocities.com/scs028a/1912List.html</a>\n\nsuggests that both vessels were present at the review.", "authorname": "perfgeek", "id": "8602872-2349133889-72157607138626377", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2349133889/#comment72157614447324397", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "29079609@N02", "iconserver": "5491", "datecreate": "1235793660", "_content": "an extremely deail account of the event.
