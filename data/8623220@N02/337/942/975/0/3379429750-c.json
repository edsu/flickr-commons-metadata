He was the first commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration. ... In 1912, Wiley resigned and took over the laboratories of Good Housekeeping magazine, where he continued his work on behalf of the consuming public. His disapprobation of &quot;drugged&quot; products included as the caffeine in cola drinks, against which he warned as vehemently as he would have against the cocaine they had once contained. In a famous action brought against the Coca-Cola company in 1911, he contended that it was illegal to use the name Coca-Cola when there was no actual cocaine in the drink, and also that it was illegal for it to contain caffeine as an additive. Perversely, this was as much as to say that the product ought to have contained cocaine and not caffeine. Still, the case was a landmark in developing standards for truth in labelling.\nSource: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_W._Wiley\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_W._Wiley</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-3379429750-72157621828793086", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3379429750/#comment72157621875314050", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anne_loc", "author": "35014516@N03", "iconserver": "3087", "datecreate": "1248807335", "_content": "Thanks for Wiley's fuller name.
