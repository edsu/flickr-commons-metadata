He was one of several star witnesses in the Becker-Rosenthal trial, among these being fellow gamblers Bridgie Webber, Harry Vallon, and Sam Schepps. Rose's testimony was the most damaging because he directly implicated Becker in arranging the murder of Herman Rosenthal. As Becker's debt collector, Rose confessed to hiring the Lenox Avenue Gang, providing the getaway car. He testified he did it all on the orders of Charles Becker.", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-5517542408-72157626246154000", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5517542408/#comment72157626121497009", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1299891255", "_content": "Another Bain/LOC photo of Jack Rose:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5249226694/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5517542408-72157626121497009", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5517542408/#comment72157626251591746", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "44110770@N06", "iconserver": "2638", "datecreate": "1299964183", "_content": "If I am not mistaken, F.
