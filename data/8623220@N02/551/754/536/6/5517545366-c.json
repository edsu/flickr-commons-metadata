Scans of the almost 40,000 plates in the collection are online at the LOC, <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/ggbain/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/ggbain/</a>\n\nThis baseball scene shows two techniques for writing on glass negatives.  Keep in mind that the original negative is different from what you see here -- the white or clear areas of the original negative display here as black, and the darker areas of the negative display here as lighter areas. The digital image reverses the polarity of the negative, like making a print from a negative.\n\n(1)  The Bain News Service staff scratched letters into the emulsion on a glass plate using a sharp-pointed tool. They wrote the letters backwards, so that the words read correctly left-to-right when the negative is printed. The Bain staff made a lot of prints from the same negative and many prints every day. The etching technique made it easy to label each print and to tell one print from another -- the basic identification information was right there on the front of each print. &quot;Etching&quot; letters backwards can also be hard to do, so the etched text tends to be brief. \nExample:  &quot;SMITH, BKLYN&quot; consists of black letters here, but the letters are clear on the original negative--lines where the emulsion has been scratched off.\n\n(2) The Bain News Service staff also wrote with black ink on the glass side of a negative--the light letters in this image. That way their notes could be made more quickly (without writing backwards). In the scan, these words and dates appear in &quot;mirror image&quot;  because they are on the glass side rather than the emulsion side of the plate. The benefit of writing dates and ids on the glass?  It's a quick way to note the basic ID info for negatives as they arrived at the news photo service--the paper sleeves and index cards came later. Also, when pulling a negative from the files to print, you had a quick confirmation right on the plate that you had the correct negative. \nExamples:  &quot;SS 4/20/14&quot; on the side of the negative  and  &quot;Smith  3rd baseman Brooklyn&quot; at the top of the negative", "authorname": "The Library of Congress", "id": "8602872-5517545366-72157626249825434", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5517545366/#comment72157626125997119", "realname": "james anthony gue lee han", "path_alias": "jellyjellyjompers", "author": "89499427@N00", "iconserver": "1423", "datecreate": "1299958814", "_content": "are these images reversed, then? \n\n\n\n indelible black  ink on the glass side  , !, thank you", "authorname": "Ed Gilvarte", "id": "8602872-5517545366-72157626125997119", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5517545366/#comment72157626166669057", "realname": "Omri Suissa", "path_alias": "omrisuissa", "author": "40770476@N06", "iconserver": "8553", "datecreate": "1300424878", "_content": "Very good\nThanks for sharing", "authorname": "Omri Suissa", "id": "8602872-5517545366-72157626166669057", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "5517545366"}}
