Although his first profitable writing was music and literary criticism, in which capacity he wrote many highly articulate pieces of journalism, his main talent was for drama, and he wrote more than 60 plays. Nearly all his writings deal sternly with prevailing social problems, but have a vein of comedy to make their stark themes more palatable. Shaw examined education, marriage, religion, government, health care, and class privilege.", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-5332817135-72157625644855839", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5332817135/#comment72157625800822922", "realname": "Arden", "path_alias": "arden_loc", "author": "35072786@N08", "iconserver": "3331", "datecreate": "1294765687", "_content": "Thank you Richard Arthur Norton.
