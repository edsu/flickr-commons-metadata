This work is a collection of the presentations made by Joaqu\u00edn D. Casasus to the arbitration panel charged with deciding the Chamizal dispute and is considered his finest legal effort. Because of his arguments, Mexico was awarded a substantial part of the disputed area, although the United States refused to recognize the arbitrators\u2019 findings. The dispute arose because the Rio Grande river channel shifted significantly in 1864, placing in Texas about 600 acres of formerly Mexican territory as awarded in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (among the historical arguments cited is the Disturnell Treaty map). As generally understood, the Treaty allowed the border to shift with the Rio Grande, so long as the shift was gradual and caused by silting and other slow-acting factors. The arbitration panel was convened by both countries to decide the matter. Despite their ruling, the dispute was not totally solved until 1963, when President Kennedy agreed to the original arbitration findings.
