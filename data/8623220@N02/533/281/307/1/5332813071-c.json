Matches were rumored with Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, Crown Prince Carol of Romania, Edward, Prince of Wales, eldest son of Britain's George V, and with Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. Olga herself wanted to marry a Russian and remain in her home country. Olga's murder following the Russian Revolution of 1917 resulted in her canonization as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church. In later years, when dozens of people made claims to be surviving members of the imperial family, a woman named Marga Boodts claimed to be Grand Duchess Olga, but her claim was not taken seriously. Olga was assassinated along with her family at Ekaterinburg. Her remains were identified through DNA testing and were buried during a funeral ceremony in 1998 at Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg along with those of her parents and two of her sisters.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Olga_Nikolaevna_of_Russia\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Olga_Nikolaevna_of_Ru...</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Tatiana_Nikolaevna_of_Russia\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Tatiana_Nikolaevna_of...</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-5332813071-72157625708676775", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "5332813071"}}
