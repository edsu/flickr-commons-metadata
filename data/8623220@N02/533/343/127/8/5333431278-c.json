This act placed the two countries at the brink of war, creating a considerable amount of international tension.  Agentina, Brazil and Chile offered to mediate the dispute and their offer was accepted by the Mexican and American governments. Niagara Falls was selected as the location for the peace conference, with the meetings taking place at the Clifton House Hotel, now the  site of Oakes Garden Theatre.  The talks began on May 20. After about a month, an agreement was reached that averted a war between Mexico and the United States.  However, Mexico's internal strife continued. On Sunday, May 24, shortly after the conference had opened, all the delegates and their families, along with many local residents and members of the press, attended a special peace mass at Our Lady of Peace. It was a proud and significant day for Our Lady of Peace.&quot;\n\nAccording to <a href=\"http://www.cliftonhill.com/attractions/niagara-parks/oakes-garden-theatre\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.cliftonhill.com/attractions/niagara-parks/oakes-garde...</a>\nthe Oakes Garden Theatre &quot;is the entranceway to Queen Victoria Park, Niagara Parks' centerpiece that showcases the Falls. &quot;   and was built in 1936 (presumably demolishing the hotel in this Bain photo, if it hadn't been taken down earlier).", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-5333431278-72157625771599024", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5333431278/#comment72157625683054455", "realname": "Arden", "path_alias": "arden_loc", "author": "35072786@N08", "iconserver": "3331", "datecreate": "1294857254", "_content": "Thanks swanq for the information about the Clifton Hotel and its role in the 1914 Niagara Falls peace conference.
