The first Mrs. J. K. Hackett was Engilsh stage actress Mary Mannering (1876-1953); the couple married in 1897.  They had one child, Elise.  In 1908, Mary began divorce proceedings, but then called them off; in 1909, James had financial problems enough to make the papers.  In time,  James Hackett married English actress Beatrice Mary Beckley (b. 1885, married Hackett in 1911), and Mary Mannering married another man, Frederick E. Wadsworth.  \n\nIf this image was made in 1914, that should be the second Mrs. Hackett, Beatrice Mary Beckley.  Beatrice and James starred together in a 1913 film of The Prisoner of Zenda.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Keteltas_Hackett\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Keteltas_Hackett</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0065773/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.imdb.com/name/nm0065773/</a>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Mannering\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Mannering</a>", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-5333428778-72157625771961294", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5333428778/#comment72157625676160365", "realname": "Arden", "path_alias": "arden_loc", "author": "35072786@N08", "iconserver": "3331", "datecreate": "1294774715", "_content": "pennylrichardsca: thanks for the research on James Keteltas Hackett and his wife Beatrice Mary Beckley.
