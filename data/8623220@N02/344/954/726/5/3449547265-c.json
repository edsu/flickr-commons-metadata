Yes their were public toilets below street level and this was one of the reasons the area was a major bus terminus. The Statue looks to be Gordon of Khartoum and as you correctly say it sits in a tiny park in front of the Robert Gordon's College on Schoolhill. If you look at the arch at the right shoulder of the statue its the entrance to Lodge Walk the old Police Headquarters. The old jail &quot;The Tolbooth&quot;, is sited inside the arch and on Union Street there is a small brass plaque where the gallows was sited for executions. Opposite King Street is Marshall Street and my Great Great grandfather was marched to a ship from the jail with a ball and chain and sent to Australia for stealing a horse.", "authorname": "northernkite", "id": "8602872-3449547265-72157629780815007", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3449547265/#comment72157635269893709", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66311327@N05", "iconserver": "7333", "datecreate": "1377712951", "_content": "Streetview: <a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=57.148351,-2.092053&amp;spn=0.000576,0.004128&amp;t=h&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=57.148352,-2.092052&amp;panoid=SXhTtesW9Wy8XhAPd-oteg&amp;cbp=12,250.6,,0,-5.03\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com/maps?ll=57.148351,-2.092053&amp;spn=0.000...</a>", "authorname": "B-59", "id": "8602872-3449547265-72157635269893709", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "3449547265"}}
