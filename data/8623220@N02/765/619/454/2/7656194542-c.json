The New York Times referred to him during this time as a propagandist and the Kaiser's spokesman, and published many articles about his speeches.  He left the country after the sinking of the Lusitania (which he defended) and the publication by the Times of an article detailing efforts by the Wilson administration to find a way to charge him criminally for his statements and activities.\nThis photo was probably taken at the Ritz-Carlton, where he stayed during his time in New York.\n<a href=\"http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20915FC3E5A15738DDDAA0994DD405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20915FC3E5A1573...</a>\n<a href=\"http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA061EF8395B17738DDDAF0994DD405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA061EF8395B1773...</a>\n<a href=\"http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60911FF3B5C13738DDDAB0994DE405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60911FF3B5C1373...</a>\nAnother  Bain Collection photo of Dernburg:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6220318154/\" title=\"Delbruck, Dernburg, Zeppelin, Coleman (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6171/6220318154_3e53bbfe8c_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"175\" alt=\"Delbruck, Dernburg, Zeppelin, Coleman (LOC)\" /></a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-7656194542-72157630860816864", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7656194542"}}
