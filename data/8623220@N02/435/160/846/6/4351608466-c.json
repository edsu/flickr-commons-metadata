Cullen presided over the impeachment trial of New York Governor William Sulzer, in 1913. (In the final vote, Judge Cullen cast his ballot against conviction, but Sulzer was convicted anyway -- the only New York Governor ever removed from office by impeachment.\n\nSulzer had campaigned as a reform governor, and once in office, barged ahead with his reform program, in defiance of Tammany Hall's boss Murphy. So Murphy called his minions to impeach Sulzer, using misuse of campaign funds as a pretext. Here, from 2006 is a tidy NYT recap of the whats and wherefore's of Sulzer's impeachment:\n<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/30/nyregion/30impeach.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nytimes.com/2006/10/30/nyregion/30impeach.html</a>", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4351608466-72157623317022759", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4351608466"}}
