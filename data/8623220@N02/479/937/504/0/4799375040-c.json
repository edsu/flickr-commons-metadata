A hundred years ago, it was famous as the home of the Roycrofters, an artisans community founded by Elbert Hubbard, an exponent of the Arts and Crafts movement. Some of the Roycroft buildings are undergoing restoration now. The Roycroft colony had its own baseball team, which used the Roycroft logo on its uniforms.
