The book placed heavy emphasis on his interest in Spiritualism, including phenomena like spirit photographs -- an interest that she shared. Like her father, Estelle Wilson Stead was English (lived near Cambridge, England), but also had strong U. S. ties, and her book was published in New York as well as in London. The Bain News Agency probably circulated this photograph to its subscribers when the book came out.
