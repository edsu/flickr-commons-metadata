The congress was held every 10 years, and this was an auspicious opportunity to share experiences and enthusiasms with thousands of people from 58 countries including England, Australia, New Zealand, United States and Canada.\n\nThe largest delegation, outside of England, was from the United States, which sent 600 men and women and 100 children. The American delegation included four bands, from New York; Chicago; Worcester, Massachusetts; and Flint, Michigan. The 55 band members from Flint were auto workers, and their expenses were paid by local businessmen. Elsewhere, American delegates paid their own expenses.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5621414095-72157626518837520", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621414095/#comment72157626394184047", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1303072110", "_content": "Other Bain/LOC photos of the 1914 Salvation Army Congress:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5642865585/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621414477/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5643434468/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621414353/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621414211/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5622001734/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5622001618/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5621414095-72157626394184047", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621414095/#comment72157626527692646", "realname": "Zainul Abedin", "path_alias": null, "author": "24657778@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1303165376", "_content": "Wonderful capture.\nSo vivid and lovely!", "authorname": "szainul_abedin", "id": "8602872-5621414095-72157626527692646", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621414095/#comment72157626633726633", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1305827768", "_content": "Wystan,\n\nThanks for collecting the images related to this event, and for the further details.
