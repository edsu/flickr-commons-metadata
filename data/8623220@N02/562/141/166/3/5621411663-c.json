Roseberry, this photo depicts the christening and launching of the Curtiss Model H Flying Boat &quot;America&quot; on June 22, 1914 in Hammondsport, New York, just adjacent to Keuka Lake.  From left to right, aviators John Cyril Porte, George E.A. Hallett, and (builder) Glenn Curtiss stand below 16-year old Miss Katherine Masson.  Miss Masson, the daughter of Leon Masson, an official with the Pleasant Valley Wine Company (and granddaughter of Jules Masson), was chosen to christen the America with a bottle of champagne (which proved to be a fitful task).\n\nThe aircraft's construction by Glenn Curtiss was commissioned by Rodman Wanamaker, the son of department store founder John Wanamaker, in order to compete for the \u20a410,000 prize offered by the <i>Daily Mail</i> newspaper for the first non-stop aerial crossing of the Atlantic Ocean.   The Curtiss Model H-1 flying boat was Initially known as the &quot;Rodman Wanamaker Transatlantic Flyer,&quot; but the name &quot;America&quot; was chosen for the aircraft by Wanamaker.\n\nUltimately, the outbreak of the the First World War would intercede and &quot;America&quot; would never make its planned transatlantic flight.  \n\nHere's a link to British Pathe newsreel film of the assembly and christening of the America, along with footage of a stubborn bottle of champagne.\n<a href=\"http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=80471\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=80471</a>\n\nAnother Bain photo of the trio and Miss Masson:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621411353/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "8602872-5621411663-72157626379359147", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621411663/#comment72157626519108870", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1303073939", "_content": "Other Bain/LOC photos of the flying boat, &quot;America&quot;:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5622001122/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621412427/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621999814/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621999502/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621999814/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621410871/in/photostream/]\nand another Curtiss flying boat:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621999948/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5621411663-72157626519108870", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621411663/#comment72157626430414049", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1303509591", "_content": "TVL1970:\n\nThank you so much for the extremely detailed information, complete with source citation.
