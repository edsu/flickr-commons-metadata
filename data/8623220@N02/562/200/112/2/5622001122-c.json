They were to fly the Rodman Wanamaker airship, America, from Newfoundland to Ireland in the summer of 1914.  The original plan had been to fly in June, but  problems with the plane's design led to postponement well into July.  Porte insisted on flying at night during the full moon so that he could navigate by the stars.  By the time the America was ready to fly, the next avialable date that met Porte's criteria was in August 1914.  Unfortunately, the outbreak of The Great War that month caused the ocean crossing to be cancelled.", "authorname": "puzzlemaster", "id": "8602872-5622001122-72157626379494499", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5622001122/#comment72157626519182302", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1303074547", "_content": "Other Bain/LOC photos of the flying boat, &quot;America&quot;:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621412427/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621999814/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621999502/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621411663/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621411353/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621411217/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621410871/in/photostream/]\nand another Curtiss boatplane:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5621999948/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5622001122-72157626519182302", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5622001122/#comment72157626402487007", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1303160458", "_content": "I started an entry for Hallett:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eustace_Amyot_Hallett\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eustace_Amyot_Hallett</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-5622001122-72157626402487007", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5622001122/#comment72157626555086944", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1303509788", "_content": "puzzlemaster, Wystan and Richard Arthur Norton,\n\nThanks to all for both bringing more information to these photographs as well as gathering related images.
