She made the news herself in 1911, when she jumped into Huntington Bay, Long Island, from the yacht Paula, &quot;with all her wraps on,&quot; to save a waiter who had fallen out of his canoe.   She also directed films, often starring her own children Violet and Charles, set at the family estate in Oyster Bay.
