The team was named by owner Robert Ward, who owned the Tip Top Bakery. They were sometimes called the Brooklyn Feds due to being the Brooklyn team of the Federal League. The Tip Tops played in old Washington Park, which the Brooklyn Dodgers had abandoned after the 1912 season to move to Ebbets Field.\n\nFrom Baseball Encyclopedia.com:\n&quot;With Harry Sinclair, Ward was one of the main backers of the Federal League. As owner of the Brooklyn franchise, he poured more than a million dollars into the cause. He offered to share any team profits with his players, but there was never anything to share. A month after Ward died, the league also succumbed.
