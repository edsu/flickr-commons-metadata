I think it's pretty likely this group is at the party on Governor's Island, despite the lack of mention of Mrs. J.H. Hammond in the New York Times article. (And those feathers on Mrs. Leary's do look like they may be aigrettes though it's not easy to tell if they are green, as the article details! Aigrettes were usually egret or white heron plumes, but the term also was used for other similar-looking feathers.)  We will update this record to reflect these new details.", "authorname": "Kristi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-5496667277-72157626119805557", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5496667277"}}
