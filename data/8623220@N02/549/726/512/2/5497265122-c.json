Also, a Hilma Kallio is mentioned among the survivors in a NYTimes story dated 3 June 1914:\n\n<blockquote>\nThis afternoon a small group stood around a coffin in the Morgue where the victims have lain since Sunday morning.  A photograph was bring passed from hand to hand, and as each received it, he glanced at the face in the coffin.  'Yes, I am sure it is she,' said the owner of the photograph, and he gave the name to the clerk who had charge of the section.  \n\n'Hilma Kallio of Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.,' said he.\n\nThen he gave his own name, Vincent Kallio of Kinross, Mich., and stated that he was her brother.\n\n'Hilma Kallio,' said an official in a puzzled voice.  'Why, she's not missing, is she?'\n\nHastily they examined the list.  And then they found the name among the saved.  A ticket had been provided to send the girl back to her home in Michigan.\n\nThe man broke into tears of joy.  Soon he was smiling.  He thanked the officials who had helped him and left the Morgue.\n</blockquote>", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-5497265122-72157626069964365", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5497265122/#comment72157626195416790", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11418107@N02", "iconserver": "1068", "datecreate": "1299259939", "_content": "There's a Hilma Kallio mentioned in an obituary here; she died in 1948, according to her husband's Jack Hill's obituary from 1961; they seem to have lived in Nolalu, Northern Ontario, Finnish Lutherans, her surviving brothers in 1961 are listed as Richard and Emil.\n<a href=\"http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jmitchell/obitsh.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jmitchell/obit...</a>", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-5497265122-72157626195416790", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5497265122/#comment72157626070070485", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11418107@N02", "iconserver": "1068", "datecreate": "1299260066", "_content": "There's a Hilma Taavettila listed among the Finnish survivors in this document:\n<a href=\"http://www.migrationinstitute.fi/articles/008_Tuominen.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.migrationinstitute.fi/articles/008_Tuominen.pdf</a>\nThe woman on the right might be Hilma Taavettila--it would be an easy name to misspell.", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-5497265122-72157626070070485", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5497265122/#comment72157626074558485", "realname": "Zinaida Beaumont", "path_alias": null, "author": "37408767@N03", "iconserver": "3494", "datecreate": "1299323241", "_content": "Empress of Ireland is not the same thing as Empress of Ire.
