Bedruthan steps have been a popular destination since the late Victorian period, when visitors to the new resort of Newquay enjoyed carriage rides here. The entrepreneurial local farmer charged for stalls for the carriages at 1 shilling per horse. Visitors walking to the site could enter free of charge.\n\nIndividually named rocks include: Samaritan Island, named after the ship which was wrecked on the beach here in 1846; and Queen Bess Rock, believed to have once borne a resemblance to the Virgin Queen.\n&quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-8476470340-72157632803085602", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "8476470340"}}
