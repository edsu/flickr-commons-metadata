Although it weighs some 80 tons, it was dislodged in 1824 by a group of British seamen, intent on showing what the Navy could do. However following complaints from local residents for whom the rock had become a tourist attraction and source of income, the seamen were forced to restore it.\n\nToday the Logan Rock still rocks, but with much less ease than it did in the past.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Rock\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Rock</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.panoramio.com/photo/58444659\" rel=\"nofollow\">panoramio photo by David Booth</a>", "authorname": "B-59", "id": "8602872-8476473590-72157632779966422", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "8476473590"}}
