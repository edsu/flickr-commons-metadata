The castle is a Norman motte and bailey earthwork castle raised by Robert, Count of Mortain, half-brother of William the Conqueror shortly after the Norman conquest, possibly as early as 1067. Others attribute its foundation to Brian of Brittany though he only stayed in England for about five years after the Conquest.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_Castle\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_Castle</a>\n\nModern view:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sic_itur_ad_astra/8391946107/\" title=\"launceston castle 1 by Sic Itur Ad Astra, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8082/8391946107_78c265e7c5_m.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"240\" alt=\"launceston castle 1\" /></a>", "authorname": "B-59", "id": "8602872-8476471770-72157632775210715", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "8476471770"}}
