He was the younger brother of middleweight boxer Mike Gibbons.\n\nHe began fighting professionally in 1911 and retired from the ring in 1925 after 94 wins, 5 losses and three draws. In 1923, he challenged heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey for the title, losing by a decision, though he became the only boxer to last a full 15 rounds with the Manassa Mauler.\n\nLike his brother, Tommy Gibbons was a hard hitter who gained a large percentage of his wins by KO. He was knocked out only once himself, in the twelfth round of his final fight, by future heavyweight champion Gene Tunney. \n\nHe was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Human:11254\">BoxRec biography page</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=011254&amp;cat=boxer\">BoxRec bout list</a>.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-2830852768-72157607152499592", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2830852768"}}
