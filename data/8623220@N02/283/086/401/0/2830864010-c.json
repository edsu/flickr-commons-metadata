In a 1-1 game in the bottom of the ninth, with Giants runners on first (Merkle) and third, a Giant player lined a single that brought in the supposed winning run. Giants fans stormed the Polo Grounds field, and in the chaos that ensued a Cubs player stood on second base with the ball. After a hasty conference, the umpires ruled that Merkle never touched second base and was ruled out on a force play. The game ended in a tie, rather than a Giants win, and the Cubs went on to win the pennant and the 1908 World Series. The verb &quot;to Merkle,&quot; meaning to leave something incomplete, entered the American lexicon.", "authorname": "RedSoxWon", "id": "8602872-2830864010-72157615376183616", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2830864010/#comment72157622993297454", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "45549302@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1260730862", "_content": "darn! im related to him", "authorname": "yodiddydawg", "id": "8602872-2830864010-72157622993297454", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2830864010/#comment72157627195714674", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "13877445@N06", "iconserver": "7281", "datecreate": "1310676383", "_content": "Going by the uniforms in the photo, I'd have to say that the Giants were in the field and a Red Sox runner was safe at second.", "authorname": "murphman61", "id": "8602872-2830864010-72157627195714674", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2830864010/#comment72157630529871616", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1342022135", "_content": "LOC, You should probably ask the Sabr committee to take another look at this ID.\n\nI agree with Murphman61.
