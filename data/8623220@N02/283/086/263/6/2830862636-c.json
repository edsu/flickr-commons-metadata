I think this is the top of the 3rd inning in Game #4 at New York and Boston's Steve Yerkes has grounded back the pitcher, Jeff Tesreau, who then forced the runner (Red Sox pitcher, Joe Wood - in a sweater) out at third.\nThird baseman Buck Herzog is shown having thrown to first in an unsuccessful attempt to double up the speedy Yerkes, who can be seen racing down the line.  The umpire can be seen calling Wood out at third.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NY1/NY1191210110.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NY1/NY1191210110.shtml</a>", "authorname": "murphman61", "id": "8602872-2830862636-72157631911853739", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2830862636"}}
