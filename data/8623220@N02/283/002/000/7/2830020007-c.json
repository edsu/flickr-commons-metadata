On New Year's Day, 1913, he was declared &quot;White Heavyweight Champion of the World&quot; after defeating Al Palzer in a fight at Vernon, California. \n\nHis promising career (his nickname was &quot;Luck&quot;) was cut short when he died of a brain hemorrhage on May 24, 1913, shortly after being knocked out by Canadian boxer Arthur Pelkey two minutes into a fight at Calgary, Alberta. \n\nPelkey broke down and cried on hearing the news of McCarty's death. His own career seems to have been adversely affected by the event. He lost the title in his next fight, on January 1, 1914, and though prior to the McCarty fight he had suffered only three losses and had won over twenty bouts, afterward he had only four wins in more than twenty fights.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=39623&amp;cat=boxer\">Luther McCarty's BoxRec bout list</a>.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-2830020007-72157607132366776", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2830020007/#comment72157607182469251", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1220889915", "_content": "Thanks!
