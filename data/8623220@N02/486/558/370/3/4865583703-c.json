Bicknell (1866-1943) \n&quot;Ogunquit, Maine&quot; \nOil on artist's board \nGift of Mr. Charles Tyler \n1973.18 \n  \n&quot;Bicknell's small painting renders the sun-drenched coast of Maine with startling freshness. Working on the spot with a palette knife, the artist applied paint directly to the board to construct the rock's craggy surface. He used the color of the bare support itself to suggest the cliff's sharp crevices. \n  \n&quot;Bicknell, who never married and was likely gay, regarded Miss Florence [Richardson] and the members of the Lyme Art Colony as &quot;the family.&quot; He and other Lyme artists sometimes fled Connecticut's late summer humidity to sketch and fish in Maine. In addition to painting in Ogunquit, a small fishing village on Maine's south coast, Bicknell spent time with Lyme artists Walter Griffin, Arthur Heming, and Charles Ebert at Monhegan Island. Bicknell maintained a life-long connection to Lyme through the home left to him as a bequest by the artist Lewis Cohen, a fellow Griswold House boarder.&quot;", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4865583703-72157624568365113", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865583703/#comment72157624568410411", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1281417863", "_content": "Other Bain/LOC photos of the Beaux Arts Society's Venetian Pageant, at the Hotel Astor, February 20, 1914:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865583275/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865583415/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865582597/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865583077/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865583559/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4865583703-72157624568410411", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865583703/#comment72157624696064344", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1281458100", "_content": "More Bain/LOC photos of performers in the Beaux Arts Society's Venetian Pageant:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4866202530/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865584169/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865584485/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865583995/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4865583703-72157624696064344", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865583703/#comment72157624977778420", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1284762646", "_content": "Thank you to all for research into this interesting event!
