He was the one surviving child from that marriage. His paternal grandfather was Ludwig III of Bavaria, the last King of Bavaria who was deposed in 1918.\nHis family, the House of Wittelsbach, were opposed to the regime of Nazi Germany and in 1940 Albrecht took his family to his estate at S\u00e1rv\u00e1r, Vas, Hungary. In October 1944, when Germany occupied Hungary, the Wittelsbachs were arrested and imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp at Oranienburg, Brandenburg. In April 1945 they were moved to the Dachau concentration camp, where they were liberated by the United States Army. Albrecht became Head of the Royal Family of Bavaria with the death of his father on 2 August 1955. From that date he was regarded by Jacobites as the rightful King of England, Scotland, Ireland and France.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht,_Duke_of_Bavaria\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht,_Duke_of_Bavaria</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-4865580527-72157624560962671", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4865580527"}}
