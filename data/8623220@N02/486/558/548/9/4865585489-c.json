In 1894 she married her paternal first cousin Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse. Their marriage was a failure and ended in divorce in 1901. Victoria scandalized the royal families of Europe when she married her maternal first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich in 1905. Family opposition was so great that the couple was initially banished from Russia. In 1909 they were allowed to return. After the fall of the Russian monarchy in 1917, they were forced to live in exile. In 1926 Kirill self proclaimed emperor in exile and Victoria Melita supported her husband claims.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Victoria_Melita_of_Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Victoria_Melita_of_Saxe-Co...</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-4865585489-72157624560676035", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4865585489/#comment72157624769643124", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1282344590", "_content": "Thanks for the additional details!
