Pelham was a 1 block street between Pike St and Rutgers St and does not exist at all anymore, and Monroe St used to run between Cherry St and Madison St east of the Manhattan Bridge, and has been absorbed in that area and exists only west of the bridge now. I couldn't find any information on this fire, but sadly, many of the victims of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire if 1911 lived on this street.  The poor immigrant neighborhood can also be discerned in the Jewish or Yiddish window signs.  \n\nyou can find the streets at the SE tip of the island here\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Map/Man.1911.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Map/Man.1911.html</a>", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-4690773334-72157624130300647", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "4690773334"}}
