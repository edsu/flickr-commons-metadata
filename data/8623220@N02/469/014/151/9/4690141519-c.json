Thaw, the murderer of Architect Stanford White, was extradicted back over the border to the U. S., then spent several months in limbo in Concord, New Hampshire, resisting return to New York for a trial on escape charges. He finally was hauled back to NY on January 23, 1914. In 1915 he was judged restored to sanity, and let off scott free.\n\nAnother Bain/LOC photo of Harry Thaw, in the sheriff's office in Concord, NH (Click on the photo for further links and text):\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4390172636/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4690141519-72157624282126668", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4690141519/#comment72157624536029896", "realname": "Mags", "path_alias": "seamonkeymags", "author": "95762360@N00", "iconserver": "2118", "datecreate": "1279549574", "_content": "Poor Evelyn Nesbit.", "authorname": "seamonkey mags", "id": "8602872-4690141519-72157624536029896", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4690141519"}}
