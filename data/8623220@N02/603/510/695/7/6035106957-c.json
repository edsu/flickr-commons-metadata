I believe the Russian Knight is the first multi-engine, fixed wing aircraft, and a later version became the first 4 engine aircraft. Sikorsky immigrated to the U.S. in 1919, developed the first practical helicopter in 1939, and later designs of the Sikorsky Aircraft Company were chosen to serve the U.S. President.

He named it &quot;Russkiy vityaz&quot; (Russian Knight) but it soon became known as the &quot;Grand&quot; or &quot;Le Grand.&quot; A giant machine at the time, it had a wingspan of 88 ft. 7 in. and a length of 65 ft. 7 in. The fuselage was covered with plywood for greater rigidity. Initially the airplane had two 100-horsepower Argus engines, but two more were added for the first historic flight near St. Petersburg on May 26, 1913. \n\n(Source: D.
