There was quite a large number of paper mills located in the valley. Some of them were active up to the 1950's and 1960's. Maina Inferiore belonged to the Maffizzoli family, which finally founded the only remaining paper mill in Toscolano-Maderno. This new mill is still producing. The mill shown on the picture today serves as a museum for the valley's history.", "authorname": "jomaot", "id": "8602872-4711366747-72157626800680817", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4711366747"}}
