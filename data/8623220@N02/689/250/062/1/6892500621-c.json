Someone in his death agony, we thought. But an hour later the cry came again. It never ceased the whole night. Nor the following night. Naked and inarticulate the cry persisted. We could not tell whether it came from the throat of German or Frenchman. It existed in its own right, an agonized indictment of heaven and earth. We thrust our fingers into our ears to stop its moan; but it was no good; the cry cut like a drill into our heads, dragging minutes into hours, hours into years. We withered and grew old between those cries.\n\n&quot;Later we learned that it was one of our own [German] men hanging on the wire. Nobody could do anything for him; two men had already tried to save him, only to be shot themselves. We prayed desperately for his death. He took so long about it, and if he went on much longer we should go mad. But on the third day his cries were stopped by death.&quot;\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-6892500621-72157629363844875", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6892500621/#comment72157629363974935", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "8572707@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1329526409", "_content": "what a poignant passage. . . . .cool picture. . . .cell phone indeed. . .Willy", "authorname": "Willykayak", "id": "8602872-6892500621-72157629363974935", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6892500621/#comment72157629366169635", "realname": "Tom Jacobs", "path_alias": "tjacobs61", "author": "37057979@N05", "iconserver": "3372", "datecreate": "1329543332", "_content": "Thanks for sharing this historical picture.", "authorname": "tjacobs61", "id": "8602872-6892500621-72157629366169635", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6892500621/#comment72157631939668861", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "89711082@N07", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1352175129", "_content": "Thank you for giving this rare info.
