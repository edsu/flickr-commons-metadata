Unlike the other Chinatown shots, this has no Chinese businesses or people who look particularly Chinese.  I can't find a match for the printing company, but Nadel &amp; Shimmel toy company is listed in the Polk City Directory for 1919 at 132 Park Row.  They might have moved or occupied more than one building on the block.\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EJw0AQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;authuser=0&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">play.google.com/books/reader?id=EJw0AQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec...</a>\nI think this block of Park Row buildings was demolished to make way for the new approaches to the Brooklyn Bridge in the mid-1950's.\n\n\nSo it's not clear to me why this photo is in the Bain news stream.  Perhaps it is related to the shooting referenced in a nearby Chinatown photo, but I cannot come up with a match.", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6892485931-72157631799147527", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6892485931"}}
