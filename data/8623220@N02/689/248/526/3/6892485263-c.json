As  rjones0856 states, the Church of the Transfiguration, appears in the background and is still located today at 25 Mott Street. The Port Arthur restaurant was at 7-9 Mott Street as shown  in this old postcard: <a href=\"http://www.cardcow.com/311741/port-arthur-restaurant-7-9-mott-street-new-york/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.cardcow.com/311741/port-arthur-restaurant-7-9-mott-st...</a> \n\nI think therefore that the shooting in the caption may refer to one which happened on Mott Street, rather than the one referred to in the New York Times article sent by lazygardens, which happened on Pell Street.  A July 1910 shooting in the same block of Mott Street as shown in the Bain images is detailed in this New York Times article which also mentions the  Port Arthur restaurant and the Church of the Transfiguration: <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70611FD395D11738DDDAF0994DF405B808DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70611FD395D11738...</a>\n\nHowever, probably more than one shooting occurred on Mott Street, so I don\u2019t think we can pin it down to this one, given the lack of  information in the Bain caption. \n\nBut we can add some more details about the location of these two  images in our description.
