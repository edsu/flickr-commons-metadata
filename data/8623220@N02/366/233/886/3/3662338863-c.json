Glad I found a FREE version of it for the book I'm working on.  Some person on ebay is selling it for upwards to 20$ for a print out version, or 75$ for a digital version claiming they scanned it in themselves.  Looks a lot like this one in quality.  hmmmmm.\n\nAnd Yes, not much has changed since then.  That little building with the red roof was the former &quot;Parliament Pumphouse&quot;.  Its long gone, but its complete foundation AND mini tunnel remain and its quite cool to look at and take photos of.  Just a lost piece of the city that was.  When Parliament was rebuilt in 1916, the plans called for the pumphouse to be moved next to where the supreme court stands and to have everything route that way instead.  That one is still there now.", "authorname": "mikemacjunkie1", "id": "8602872-3662338863-72157627840465051", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3662338863/#comment72157627850426981", "realname": "Arden", "path_alias": "arden_loc", "author": "35072786@N08", "iconserver": "3331", "datecreate": "1319548350", "_content": "Thank you cjuneau, jamica1, m. gifford and mikemacjunkie1 for adding more information about the buildings to this image.
