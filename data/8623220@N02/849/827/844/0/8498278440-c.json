Her parents were artists in New York City (Jerome Myers was a painter, Ethel Myers was a sculptor), who encouraged their daughter's expressive movements with private, and eventually public, exhibitions.  She danced for an early film.  In 1916, there was a Vanity Fair article about her.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Myers\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Myers</a>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BEDownes/Ethel_Myers\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BEDownes/Ethel_Myers</a>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ethel_Myers_&amp;_Daughter_5_year_old_Virginia.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ethel_Myers_%26_Daughter_5_yea...</a>\n<a href=\"http://ques.com/myers/html/virginia.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">ques.com/myers/html/virginia.html</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1056052/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.imdb.com/title/tt1056052/</a>\nA much later photo of her, still dancing:\n<a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/agc1996000079/PP/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/item/agc1996000079/PP/</a>", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-8498278440-72157632832680290", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8498278440/#comment72157632827658259", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66311327@N05", "iconserver": "7333", "datecreate": "1361560666", "_content": "see also:\n<a href=\"http://www.zoominfo.com/#!search/profile/person?personId=28304506&amp;targetid=profile\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.zoominfo.com/#!search/profile/person?personId=2830450...</a>\n\nIs she still living?", "authorname": "B-59", "id": "8602872-8498278440-72157632827658259", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8498278440/#comment72157632827704343", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11418107@N02", "iconserver": "1068", "datecreate": "1361561100", "_content": "Seems unlikely, but I guess she was an unlikely person! \n\nI've seen 1975 listed as her date of death; would like to find an obituary or gravesite to be sure.
