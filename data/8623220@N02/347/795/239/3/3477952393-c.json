E. Ballard she proceeded from Philadelphia to the Mediterranean. She carried the Hon. Richard Rush, U.S. Minister to England, to his post. Subsequently she was designated flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron, cruising on that station until March 1820. She returned to New York City on 24 April 1820.\n\nFrom 11 October 1821 until 29 August 1824 she served as flagship on the Pacific Squadron. Franklin was laid up in ordinary until the summer of 1843 when she was ordered to Boston as a receiving ship. She continued in this capacity until 1852 at which time she was taken to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, razed and broken up.\n\nSource: \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Franklin_(1815)\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Franklin_(1815)</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-3477952393-72157622840290058", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3477952393"}}
