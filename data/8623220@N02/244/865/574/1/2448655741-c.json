The Magnus Butler machine appears to be a mechanized dump wagon. There's no visible cleaning apparatus (rotary brush, conveyors, belts, etc.), just a tilting hopper with a gate at the rear and access doors on the sides.\n\nThe streets of NYC were apparently still being cleaned by men with pushbrooms and hand carts. Machines were found to be less effective and more expensive than manual laborers. The Magnus Butler motorized wagon was probably designed as a collection vehicle to carry away the rubbish from the hand carts and dump it elsewhere. The raised letters on the rear wheel casting, visible in another photo, suggest the machine may have been made in Mass. (it could just indicate the maker of the wheel hubs, but the hubs are unusual, so they could have been custom-made )\nSee <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2497227956/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2497227956/</a>\n\nFor more about street cleaning, download MODERN METHODS OF STREET CLEANING by GEORGE A.
