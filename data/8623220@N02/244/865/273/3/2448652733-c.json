While the New York Times is often a fairly reliable source for the spelling of a name, the December 15, 1912 article mentioned in several comments includes misspellings. It is identified as 'Special to the New York Times', and so may have been provided by a visiting correspondent - and not well fact-checked. This photograph shows Mrs. Malcolm Strauss and her prize-winning French Bulldog Beaux Athos.   Bain provides the identities as: Mrs. Malcolm Strauss and Beaux Attos, and this Dec 1912 column offers Mrs. Martin Straus and Beau Athos, where both names are incorrect.\n\nNumerous other articles in the New York Times reporting results of dog shows in great detail confirm both the name of the owner - and her husband - and her dog.  A good authority for the dog's name in particular is the American Kennel Stud Book of 1913, published by the National American Kennel Club.  Here he is noted as: Beaux Athos. \n\nWe will amend the record to include the correct name for the bulldog.", "authorname": "Kristi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-2448652733-72157628515185989", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2448652733"}}
