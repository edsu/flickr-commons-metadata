Repp and his unusual trick car, dubbed \u201cMaude the Motor Mule\u201d, often performed at race meets \u2013 he astonished spectators by making his car run on its \u201chind legs\u201d, spinning it around, bucking it into the air and generally making the car behave like a circus horse or mule. The Buick had a heavy weight hung over the rear end of the vehicle, concealed beneath a housing, and had individual brakes on each rear wheel. The driver controlled the position of the weight with a lever \u2013 deliberately overbalancing the car by moving the weight and making the vehicle buck into the air. Applying one of the independent brakes and locking one of the wheels then allowed the car to spin around on that wheel. The exhibition was often performed in time to music from an accompanying band which played a waltz.&quot;", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4786746845-72157624362452219", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4786746845/#comment72157624507095668", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1279237511", "_content": "A three-paragraph item about Roy Repp and his Buick appeared, with a photograph, in Popular Science Monthly, volume 87 (December 1915).\n\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=6s3uaaaamaaj&amp;pg=pa782&amp;lpg=pa782&amp;dq=roy+repp+australia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ky6sy0akfc&amp;sig=gu-sxnzvsqvhk6j_yccmchdtuwc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=l5w_tonvcnk0ngev87tubw&amp;sa=x&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0ccgq6aewbq#v=onepage&amp;q=roy\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=6s3uaaaamaaj&amp;pg=pa782&amp;l...</a> repp&amp;f=false\n\nA follow-up item appeared in the January, 1916 issue, (volume 88), on page 87.
