In return for $25,000, he agreed to keep other film companies from his battlefield, to fight in daylight whenever possible, and to reconstruct battles if the footage needed reshooting. \n\n&quot;Now the subject of an HBO film starring Antonio Banderas (And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself), Villa is one of the main protagonists in Margarita de Orellana's vivid account of the American movie industry's fascination with the events of the Mexican Revolution. \n\n&quot;Through memoir accounts, newspaper reports, and analysis of the films themselves, &quot;Filming Pancho&quot; reveals much about how Mexico was constructed in the American imagination and how the film images reinforced and justified American expansionism and racial and social prejudices.&quot;\n\n--From a description, on Amazon, of a documentary movie of Hollywood's treatment of the Mexican Revolution. (The DVD is available for purchase from various Amazon vendors.)\n_______________________________________________\n\n\nOther Bain/LOC photos documenting coverage of the Mexican Revolution by the \nMutual Film Co.:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5084034058/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4733201712/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5084030832/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4866200896/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818629666/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4787383996/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4818629472/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4909921009/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4786747391/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4786747829/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5050944015/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5084033618/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4787380880-72157624707292460", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4787380880/#comment72157624881607691", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11418107@N02", "iconserver": "1068", "datecreate": "1285100585", "_content": "I made a purse from this image:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/11418107@N02/5012848570/]", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-4787380880-72157624881607691", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4787380880/#comment72157625054482006", "realname": "Jes\u00fas Roberto Duarte", "path_alias": "jesusduarte", "author": "53461717@N08", "iconserver": "4116", "datecreate": "1285700284", "_content": "En M\u00e9xico las mujeres anteponen su apellido de soltera al de su esposo.\nElla es la Sra.
