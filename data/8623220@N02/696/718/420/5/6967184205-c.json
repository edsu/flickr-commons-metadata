From 1897 to 1900 she only appeared as a pianist. Later she went to Berlin, and London where she studied and performed with renowned opera singers.\n\nIn 1914 she was  at the peak of her career when she joined the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, where she succeeded Olive Fremstad as the company's leading Wagner soprano for three years. When America entered World War I in 1917, Wagner operas were banned as being too German.  Torn by the war, Kurt remained in the US until 1919 before returning to Germany. <i>&mdash; Excerpted from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_Kurt\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>.</i>", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-6967184205-72157629547607665", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "6967184205"}}
