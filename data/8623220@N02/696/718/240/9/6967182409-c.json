Russell of A.L. Russell, Inc. which published the reports of the New York Produce Exchange, a commodities market that traded, among many other things, in grain. In a 1918 Columbia U. publication, he is also identified has having been a member of the Exchange since 1883.  By 1918 he was working for the Federal Food Administration Grain Corporation, which was in charge of wartime wheat and grain distribution.  \nHe is probably photographed here at the New York Attorney General's offices, where the inquiry into grain and bread prices, speculation and price-fixing had begun on February 16th, 1915.
