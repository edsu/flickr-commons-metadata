This unit, under Lieutenant-Colonel Shillington, after the inspection by Their Majesties the King and Queen two days previously, left the Plain on November 6th, 1914. At Southampton the O.C. was detained by arrangements concerning the nursing sisters, and thus it devolved upon Major H. C. S. Elliot, the second in command, to take the unit across the Channel to Havre. For a few days it was billeted at Boulogne. On November 27th it opened up the well-known H\u00f4tel du Golf at Le Touquet, on the dunes near Paris Plage, as a hospital of three hundred beds \u2013 the first of a series of Canadian base hospitals along the French coast between Boulogne and Dieppe. &quot;\n  and\n&quot;The O.C., Lieutenant-Colonel A. T. Shillington, and Major F. McK. Bell had both of them been on the staff of St. Luke's Hospital in that city; the Adjutant, Captain C. A. Young, on the staff of the Ottawa General Hospital. Two of the nine officers came from Toronto, one, Major H. C. S. Elliott, from Coburg. The only officer not an Ontario man was the Quartermaster, Captain T. S. Walker, from Prince Edward Island. &quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-6967190209-72157629184044630", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6967190209/#comment72157629184113436", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1331324849", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.canadianletters.ca/cobourgLetter.php?letterid=2896\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.canadianletters.ca/cobourgLetter.php?letterid=2896</a>\nis a letter by Major Elliott about the preparations and the October 1914 Atlantic voyage.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-6967190209-72157629184113436", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "6967190209"}}
