He became one of the most powerful men in the state, building a fortune in mining, banking, ranching, and hotels. His financial empire collapsed in 1932, and he declared bankruptcy in 1935. Recovering from the disaster, he was able to build a second (though smaller) fortune, and remained an influential figure in Nevada for the rest of his life.\n\nThe photo above may date from 1912, when Wingfield was offered (but refused) an appointment to the U.S. Senate, following the death of Republican Senator George S.
