Roeder was an American soprano. She was the subject a few items published in the New York Times during the 1910s. She was the daughter of Augustus &quot;Gus&quot; Roeder of Brooklyn, a staff member of The New York World. \n\nAn item published in The Times on <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E3DA103BE633A2575BC1A9639C946296D6CF\">May 18, 1913</a>, mentioned that she was scheduled to make her debut at Covent Garden, London, as Musetta, in a production of La Boheme featuring Nellie Melba and John McCormack in the leads. But an article in the <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9902E2DF113FE633A2575BC2A9649D946296D6CF\">December 28, 1913</a> Times, when she was scheduled to sing at Nice, France, said that she had only appeared in &quot;small parts&quot; at Covent Garden the previous spring.\n\nHer career doesn't seem to have gone anywhere after that. By 1917, she was listed among the members of the large cast of a musical review called <a href=\"http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=7858\">Cheer Up</a>, at the Hippodrome Theatre in New York. In 1919 she married a Mr. George Chorpenning of New York, among the wedding announcements in the <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0CE0DD143AE03ABC4E51DFB0668382609EDE\">June 26</a> New York Times. After that, I find nothing about her in the archives.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-3220577902-72157612923902760", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3220577902/#comment72157624637647170", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1280765076", "_content": "Another Bain/LOC portrait of Frances B.
