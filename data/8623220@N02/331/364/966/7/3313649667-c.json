Of $22 million in recorded gifts, he gave over $12 million to colleges. In 1924, his largest gift -- $5 million -- established Harvard Business School. What drew him to Dartmouth was his friendship with Messrs. Tuck and Thayer and his uncle, Fisher Ames Baker, who graduated from Dartmouth in 1859. Uncle Fisher was only three years senior to George Baker. He died in 1919, leaving his entire estate to his nephew. George Baker's gifts of more than $2 million built and endowed the library named for Fisher Ames Baker. &quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-3313649667-72157614793474070", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3313649667"}}
