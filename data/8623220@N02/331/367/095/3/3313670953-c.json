At the time of her launch in May 1912, she was the largest passenger ship in the world superseding the sunken RMS Titanic. During World War I, the ship remained in port in Hamburg. After the war she was briefly commissioned into the United States Navy as USS Imperator (ID-4080) and employed for returning American troops from Europe.
