The woman on the far left was identified as Susanne Byman. The woman who is second from far right was identified as Rose Roth. \n\nIf you find any images of a horse drawing a wagon associated with the Rosalie Jones suffrage march on Washington DC, the horse may be the famed &quot;Lausanne&quot; ('the bargain horse&quot;) - so named because &quot;he was purchased for $59.98, reduced from $60&quot; to pull the Suffrage Army's yellow wagon on the march to Washington. Lausanne became an part of the news coverage during the trek (he apparently did not participate in the Long Island pageant, as he had passed away by then).\n\n- Daniel E Russell\n   Former City Historian\n   Glen Cove, Long Island\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n<i><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=FLOWER GIRLS&amp;w=8623220@N02\">Found in a search.</a></i> <em>(<a href=\"http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">?</a>)</em>", "authorname": "D E Russell", "id": "8602872-3314494582-72157623830785552", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3314494582"}}
