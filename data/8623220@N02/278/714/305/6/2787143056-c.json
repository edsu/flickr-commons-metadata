This glove in the photo has longer fingers than most gloves of that time.  The ball was not wound as tight as it is today, thus making it a bit softer, what they called the Dead Ball.  Therefore, there were few home runs hit and many of the ones that were hit were inside the park.  Batters tended to face the pitcher more so that they could see the ball better and then punch at the ball trying to place it between the fielders.  The bats had thicker handles, also.  Overall, the players were smaller and not as athletic as they are today.  They didn't believe in muscle building and conditioning like today's players.  In fact, weight training was discouraged because it was felt one would become &quot;muscle bound&quot; and not be able to throw well.  This attitude was still popular into the 1960's.  I can remember coaches also telling us to not go swimming because it would tire us out for baseball.  At any rate, I find it interesting that the bases are still 90 feet apart and the batter is usually always thrown out on a ball hit to any infielder, just as in circa 1900.  Today's players are faster, have better equipment, are more physical, but it is still a game of inches.  Ruth came along and changed the game.  Players started to swing for the fences like the Babe.  The ball was wound tighter and other sluggers such as Jimmy Foxx and Hack Wilson emerged.\n\nThanks for these great old photos.", "authorname": "budderflyman", "id": "8602872-2787143056-72157607214838194", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2787143056"}}
