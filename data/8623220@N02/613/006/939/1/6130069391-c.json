The initial crack was first noted on October 4, 1907, followed by the mass wasting of about 382,000 m\u00b3 (500,000 cubic yards) of clay. This slide caused many people to suggest the construction of the Panama Canal would be impossible; Gaillard described the slides as tropical glaciers, made of mud instead of ice. The clay was too soft to be excavated by the steam shovels, and it was therefore largely removed by sluicing it with water from a high level.&quot;</i>", "authorname": "rjones0856", "id": "8602872-6130069391-72157627692493346", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6130069391/#comment72157627705306984", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pete_loc", "author": "34911459@N08", "iconserver": "3094", "datecreate": "1316443799", "_content": "We'll fix the typo in the title.
