It was purchased by George M. Studebaker (1865-1939), an executive with the Studebaker Corporation, in 1909.\n\nIn 1916, Mrs. George (Ada) Studebaker (1866-1954), along with seven other women, founded the &quot;Rye Beach/Little Boar\u2019s Head Garden Club&quot;. Their mission statement encourages growth horticulturally and agriculturally; improvement of the neighborhood; and says &quot;members should have plenty of frivolity and elasticity.&quot; &nbsp;96 years later, the Rye Beach/Little Boar\u2019s Head Garden Club today has 75 members.

Fuller.  &nbsp;It's right on the ocean, not a five-minute walk from The Breaknolle.\n\nIf you would like to add your personal touch to the gardens at The Breaknolle, the six-bedroom, ten-bath home can be yours for $3,550,000.
