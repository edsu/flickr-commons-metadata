He has music copyrights dating from at least as recently as 2001. In the 1970s, he developed a form of Tai Chi, and has had a successful career promoting it. \n\nI found two biographies of him on the Internet, the most recent on a page updated on February 21, 2010. The earlier one, <a href=\"http://www.gkpub.com/justinstone.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, says that he formed his first orchestra in 1940. I also found an item in a 1948 issue of Billboard that said he was then forming a second orchestra. \n\nAssuming that he is still with us, if somebody who knows him sees this page, maybe they can show him this photo and he can identify the singer for us.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-5435820465-72157626000756541", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5435820465"}}
