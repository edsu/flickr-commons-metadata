Willard's powerful right uppercut had driven Young's jaw up into his brain. On January 13, 1914, a jury found Willard not guilty. In 1915, after defeating Jack Johnson in Havana, Willard became heavyweight champion of the world -- but after that he avoided fights as champ, because Buffalo Bill was paying him a minimum of a thousand dollars a day to appear as an attraction in the fabled Wild West Show -- easy money that Willard would have lost, had he lost the title. (He finally did lose -- in 1919, to Jack Dempsey, in Toledo, Ohio.)", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4626427655-72157624003206581", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4626427655/#comment72157624130173990", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "21686909@N07", "iconserver": "2188", "datecreate": "1274748324", "_content": "Yes, they are still buzzing about that boxing match in Toledo.", "authorname": "budderflyman", "id": "8602872-4626427655-72157624130173990", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4626427655/#comment72157624203625080", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1275676390", "_content": "Ah, yes -- I hear that buzzing whenever I get near Maumee -- I used to think it came from motorboats on the river.\n\nHere is a Bain/LOC full-view photo of Willard, taken on the same occasion, and posted on Flickr on June 4, 2010:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4669377372/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4626427655-72157624203625080", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4626427655/#comment72157624210836668", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1275774242", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jess_Willard\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jess_Willard</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-4626427655-72157624210836668", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4626427655/#comment72157624253491818", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1276284468", "_content": "Everyone,\n\nThanks for the information on Mr. Willard.
