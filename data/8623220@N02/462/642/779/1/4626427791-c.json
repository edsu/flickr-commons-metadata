Marked by poor planning, inadequate equipment, and a surfeit of bad luck, the expedition was harrowing, to put it mildly, and TR nearly died (as in fact some in the party did) -- but ultimately in 1914 he and his son, Kermit, and others in the party made it back to the embrace of civilization. (And the River of Doubt now bears the name Rio Roosevelt.) Roosevelt lived to write a book about his ordeal, &quot;Through the Brazilian Wilderness.&quot; The story has recently been updated and retold in a gripping bestseller (2005) by Candice Millard -- &quot;The River of Doubt; Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey,&quot;  a book that comes highly recommended by its many readers, myself included.\n\nWikipedia entry on the River of Doubt:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_River\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_River</a>", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4626427791-72157623984465695", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4626427791"}}
