Editing an image undermines the reliability of the photo as a historical document. Once we start covering up even small scratches, who's to know how much other image content we changed.\n \nSubjective choices: Different users have different preferences when it comes to replacing scratches, pumping up contrast, sharpening edges, cropping negative borders, etc.  Offering the basic image lets subsequent users make their own decisions about which features to change to suit a particular purpose or product.\n\nLack of money and time: If we had lots more resources, offering a 'cleaned up photo' in addition to the 'raw document' could be considered.  (Like pre-conservation and post-conservation images of a damaged and then repaired poster.) But our priority is basic digital access -- many more of the Library\u2019s 14 million pictures should be available online first.", "authorname": "The Library of Congress", "id": "8602872-4626426297-72157624001051161", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4626426297/#comment72157624005903511", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "21686909@N07", "iconserver": "2188", "datecreate": "1274748835", "_content": "Well, this photo has one blatant black blotch which if removed would not bother anyone, I am sure.\n\nI am not asking you to edit sharpness, crops, borders, etc.  It is just cleaning up a piece of debris that I am sure no photographer would ever wish to have on his or her photo.
