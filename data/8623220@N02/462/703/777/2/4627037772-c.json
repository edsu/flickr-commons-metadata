He married 18 Sep 1866 in Middlebury, Loudon, Virginia, Eliza Fisher Colston.\n\nB.L. Gildersleeve graduated from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University\" rel=\"nofollow\">Princeton</a> in 1849 at the age of eighteen, and went on to study under <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Johannes_Franz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johannes Franz</a> in Berlin, under <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Ritschl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Friedrich Ritschl</a> at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bonn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bonn</a> and under <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Schneidewin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Schneidewin</a> at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg-August_University_of_G%c3%b6ttingen\" rel=\"nofollow\">G\u00f6ttingen</a>, where he received his doctor's degree in 1853. From 1856 to 1876 he was professor of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language\" rel=\"nofollow\">Greek</a> at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Virginia</a>, holding the chair of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Latin</a> also from 1861 to 1866.\n\nAfter service for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_Army\" rel=\"nofollow\">Confederate States Army</a> in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Civil War</a>, during which Gildersleeve was shot in the leg, he returned to the University of Virginia.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Lanneau_Gildersleeve#cite_note-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a> Ten years later, he accepted an offer from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daniel Coit Gilman</a> of a position at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Johns_Hopkins_University\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Johns Hopkins University</a>.\n\nIn 1880, the <i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Journal_of_Philology\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Journal of Philology</a></i>, a quarterly published by the Johns Hopkins University, was established under his editorial charge, and his strong personality was expressed in the department of the <i>Journal</i> headed &quot;Brief Report&quot; or &quot;Lanx Satura,&quot; and in the earliest years of its publication every tiny detail was in his hands. His style in it, as elsewhere, is in striking contrast to that of the typical classical scholar, and accords with his conviction that the true aim of scholarship is &quot;that which is.&quot; He published a <i>Latin Grammar</i> (1867; revised with the co-operation of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gonzalez_B._Lodge&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gonzalez B. Lodge</a>, 1895 and 1899; reprinted 1997 with a bibliography of twentieth-century work on the subject) and a <i>Latin Series</i> for use in secondary schools (1875), both marked by lucidity of order and mastery of grammatical theory and methods. His edition of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Persius_Flaccus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Persius</a> (1875) is of great value.\n\nBut his bent was rather toward Greek than Latin. His special interest in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek\" rel=\"nofollow\">Christian Greek</a> was partly the cause of his editing the <i>Apologies</i> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Martyr\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justin Martyr</a> (1877), &quot;which&quot; (to use his own words) &quot;I used unblushingly as a repository for my syntactical formulae.&quot; Gildersleeve's studies under Franz had no doubt quickened his interest in Greek <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax\" rel=\"nofollow\">syntax</a>, and his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic\" rel=\"nofollow\">logic</a>, untrammeled by previous categories, and his marvelous sympathy with the language were displayed in this most unlikely of places. His <i>Syntax of Classic Greek</i> (Part I, 1900, with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=CWE_Miller&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">CWE Miller</a>) collects these formulae. Gildersleeve edited in 1885 <i>The Olympian and Pythian Odes of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pindar</a></i>, with a brilliant and valuable introduction. His views on the function of grammar were summarized in a paper on <i>The Spiritual Rights of Minute Research</i> delivered at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryn_Mawr_College\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bryn Mawr</a> on June 16, 1895. His collected contributions to literary periodicals appeared in 1890 under the title <i>Essays and Studies Educational and Literary</i>.\n\nHe was elected president of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Philological_Association\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Philological Association</a> in 1877 and again in 1908 and became a member of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Letters\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Academy of Arts and Letters</a> as well as of various learned societies. He received the degree of LL.D. from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_William_and_Mary\" rel=\"nofollow\">William and Mary</a> (1869), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harvard</a> (1896), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yale</a> (1901), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chicago</a> (1901), and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pennsylvania</a> (1911); D.C.L. from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewanee,_The_University_of_the_South\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of the South</a> (1884); L.H.D. from Yale (1891) and Princeton (1899); Litt.D. from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oxford</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cambridge</a> (1905).\n\nGildersleeve retired from teaching in 1915. Gildersleeve House, one of the undergraduate dormitories at Johns Hopkins, is named in his honor.</blockquote>via <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Lanneau_Gildersleeve\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Lanneau_Gildersleeve</a>", "authorname": "Chris Devers", "id": "8602872-4627037772-72157624108577816", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4627037772/#comment72157623988017671", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1274535369", "_content": "Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve, philologist, in his day was acknowledged as the doyen of Classical scholars in the U.
