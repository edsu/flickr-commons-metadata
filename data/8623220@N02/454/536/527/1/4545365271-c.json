He studied at the Prague Conservatory, and became upon graduation, in about 1890 became Concertmaster of the G\u00fcrzenich Orchestra of Cologne, Germany.  Kramer was then Concertmaster of the Amsterdam Concertgebouw 1892-1894. He was also at some time, perhaps just before coming to Chicago Concertmaster at the St. Petersburg Philharmonic.  In 1897, he came to Chicago to join Theodore Thomas's Orchestra.    In November, 1909, Kramer became angry at remarks made by the conductor Frederick Stock, and impulsively quit the Orchestra.  He quickly regretted his action, but it was too late.  Kramer moved to the Chicago Grand Opera, and then became Concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic for one season 1913-1914.  Kramer returned to Austria during the summer of 1914, and was apparently blocked from returning, because of the outbreak of World War 1.  He was replaced at New York Philharmonic Concertmaster by Maximilian Pilzer.  Leopold Kramer was Concertmaster of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra for one season, 1922-1923.  Established in New York City, Leopold Kramer taught at the Institute for Musical Arts (later Juilliard) 1920-1924,.  In 1924, Kramer returned to Prague to teach, and where he lived at least until 1936.  &quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-4545365271-72157623794888941", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4545365271"}}
