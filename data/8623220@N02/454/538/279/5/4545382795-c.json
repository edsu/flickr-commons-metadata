He was the youngest child and the only son of Emperor Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. He was born with haemophilia; his mother's reliance on the starets Grigori Rasputin to treat the disease helped bring about the end of the Romanov dynasty. After the February Revolution of 1917, he and his family were sent into internal exile in Tobolsk, Siberia. He was murdered alongside his parents, four sisters, and three retainers during the Russian Civil War by order of the Bolshevik government, though rumors that he had survived persisted until the 2007 discovery of his and his sister Maria's remains. The family was formally interred on 17 July 1998\u2014the eightieth anniversary of the murder\u2014and were canonized as passion bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2000.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Nikolaevich,_Tsarevich_of_Russia\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Nikolaevich,_Tsarevich_of_Ru...</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-4545382795-72157632030653205", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4545382795"}}
