This occurred in Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia and created a \u2018turf-war\u2019 between the rival leagues. Many players \u2018jumped\u2019 leagues following larger salary offers, fostering a feeling of discontent between principles on both sides. The American League Baltimore franchise pondered a shift in home venue to New York (they would become the Yankees), furthering this simmering dispute. The manager of the National League New York Giants, John McGraw, commented to the press \u201cthe Philadelphia club is not making any money. It has a big white elephant on its hands.\u201d Mr. McGraw\u2019s pejorative statement of \u201cwhite elephant\u201d implied something odd, worthless and undesirable. Interestingly, Mr. McGraw had just himself \u2018jumped\u2019 from the American League Baltimore franchise to the New York National League franchise. Connie Mack, Philadelphia Athletics\u2019 manager, and Ben Shibe the owner of the A\u2019s defiantly adopted the white elephant as their mascot. The Philadelphia Athletics found success on the field and at the box office; the franchise was anything but a white elephant. The Oakland Athletics mascot remains an elephant, these days referred to as \u2018Stomper.", "authorname": "mr.thalweg", "id": "8602872-2889437939-72157625783957760", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2889437939"}}
