He was sentenced to Auburn State Prison. He's my 2x great-grandfather (from my mom's side) and reconnected with my family after getting out. His grand-daughter (my Grandmom) tells me one night, Burton just vanished. His ID and everything else was found in his home. He was never seen again.\n\nBurton came from a family of farmers. His parents Joseph Gibson and Emily Alletta (White) Gibson sold the farm to help pay for his legal fees.\n\nBurton's wife Maud Isabella (O'Dwyer) Gibson and his daughter Marian lived with Maud's parents in New Jersey.\n\nI'm doing family history research.
