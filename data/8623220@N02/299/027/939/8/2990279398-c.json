If you layer these photos over the panorama (<a href=\"http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/pan.6a35826/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/pan.6a35826/</a>) then you'll notice the only difference is in the location of the small little sail boats and some medium-sizes vessels. They are in different positions from this image and the full panorama in the LOC collections. The photographer most likely took multiple shots of the scene that day at different exposures.\n\nIn the lower right you can see the beginnings of their signature: &quot;S\u00e9bah et Joaill(ier).&quot;\n\nIt was very common for studios when they closed or went bankrupt to sell their negatives to other studios, with each one merely imprinting their studio name on the negative.
