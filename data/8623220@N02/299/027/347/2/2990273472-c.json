This is actually German Zeppelin IV, or Z IV (also identified by its production number, LZ 16) that, due to deteriorating weather conditions, accidentally crossed over the French border and landed upon a military parade ground in Lun\u00e9ville, France on April 3, 1913.  Zeppelin IV was detained by the French military and scoured for intelligence information (such as the airship's log book) concerning the airship's technology and capability.  The airship and its crew were released from French custody after one day.  However, it returned to Germany featuring &quot;over 600 autographs of French men and women, with the phrase, 'Vive la France!' together with other epithets quite as  patriotic but less polite,&quot; as per this story from the New York Times (published May 10, 1913).\n\nTHAT INVADING ZEPPELIN.; Left Luneville Covered with Autographs and &quot;Vive la France!&quot;\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9804E6D8173FE633A25757C0A9639C946296D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9804E6D8173FE633A...</a>", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "8602872-2990273472-72157623682438370", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2990273472/#comment72157623706854150", "realname": "Jeff", "path_alias": "jeff_loc", "author": "34997905@N03", "iconserver": "3319", "datecreate": "1269604949", "_content": "Thanks for the clarification, TVL 1970.
