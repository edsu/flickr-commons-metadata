Surely if they are able to support others they are able to go out into the community where they can work for themselves.  The minute that a boy is self-supporting his place is in society and in a good home.&quot;\n</blockquote>", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-3842836312-72157622102371872", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3842836312/#comment72157621978736291", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1250876406", "_content": "I started an entry in Wikipedia:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincolndale_Agricultural_School\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincolndale_Agricultural_School</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-3842836312-72157621978736291", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3842836312/#comment72157622105364154", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1250894068", "_content": "LOC -- &quot;Lincolndale&quot; is misspelled in your title.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-3842836312-72157622105364154", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3842836312/#comment72157622016384857", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anne_loc", "author": "35014516@N03", "iconserver": "3087", "datecreate": "1251215910", "_content": "Thanks for the corrections and additional information here.
