He was educated in the public schools and by private tutors. As a teenager he worked for the Leroy Gazette, then was city editor first of the Scranton Times, then of the Post. At twenty-two he took his savings to Buffalo and in 1873 came out with his own paper, the Buffalo Sunday News, which was a success.\n\nOn October 11, 1880, his weekday paper, the Buffalo Evening News, came out and sold more than 7,000 copies on the street alone. It cost only a cent, whereas most contemporary dailies cost two or three cents. Circulation boomed to 20,000, and soon the News enjoyed the largest circulation of any paper between New York and Chicago.\n\n[In 1896, a new building was built for the newspaper operations at 218 Main St.]\n\nButler was given to leading crusades, including discipline at the Elmira Reformatory, enlargement of the Erie Canal, and a new building for the State Normal School in Buffalo.\n\nHe was an original member of the Grade Crossing Commission and continued on it for twenty-six years. He never ran for public office but was a dominant figure in the state G.O.P.\n\nHis wife was Mary E. Barber of Pittston, Pennsylvania, who died in 1893. Two children survived their father, one of whom, Edward H. Butler, Jr., succeeded when Edward, I, died in 1914. &quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-4998798496-72157625007537744", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4998798496/#comment72157624897344029", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1285301756", "_content": "I started an entry in Wikipedia on the father:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hubert_Butler,_Sr\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hubert_Butler,_Sr</a>.", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-4998798496-72157624897344029", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4998798496/#comment72157624929922631", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1285701803", "_content": "swanq:\n\nI would agree this seems more likely to be the elder Edward H.
