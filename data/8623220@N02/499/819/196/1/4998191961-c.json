He was motivated to search for a non-breakable, and clear substance on which he could place the images he utilized in his Biblical teachings. George Eastman was no doubt a member of the audience during this time. In May 2, 1887, the year Reverend Goodwin retired from the church he had served for twenty years, he filed a patent for &quot;a photographic pellicle and process of producing same . . . . especially in connection with roller cameras&quot;, but the patent was not granted until 13 September 1898.
