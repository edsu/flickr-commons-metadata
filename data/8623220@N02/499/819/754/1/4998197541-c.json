Lever personified the Northern, nonconformist conscience: he was Liberal in his politics, earnest in his philanthropic endeavors, and committed to social amelioration and moral improvement at home, as typified by Lever\u2019s company town, Port Sunlight. Although attacked for his labor policies in palm oil plantations in the Congo, he was committed to Britain\u2019s \u201ccivilizing mission\u201d overseas.[1] Starting with a small grocery business begun by his father, he began making soap in the 1880s. Lever rode the cresting late-Victorian consumer revolution to build a vast industrial empire spread across the globe, with such famous brands as Lux and Lifebuoy. Four years after his death his enterprises were amalgamated as Unilever, which, by 1930, employed a quarter of a million people and, in terms of market value, was the largest company in Britain", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-4998197541-72157624851519873", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4998197541"}}
