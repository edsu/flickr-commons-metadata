He twice led Coxey's Army (in 1894 and 1914), bands of unemployed men, on marches from Massillon to Washington, D.C. to present a &quot;Petition in Boots&quot; demanding that the United States Congress appropriate money to create jobs for the unemployed. Although his march failed, Coxey's Army was a harbinger of an issue that would rise to prominence as unemployment insurance would become a key element in the future Social Security Act.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_S._Coxey,_Sr\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_S._Coxey,_Sr</a>.", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-4998193305-72157624977884628", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4998193305"}}
