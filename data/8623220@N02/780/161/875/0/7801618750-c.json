Woodhouse constructed at her house, The Fens, on the north side of Huntting Lane in East Hampton. Unlike her aunt's Japanese garden across the street (seen in Hassam's The Water Garden), this Italianate garden was divided into &quot;rooms&quot; by concrete walls, trellis screens, and hedges and was ornamented with flowerbeds, sculpture, seats, urns, and pools. In Lilies, Hassam portrayed one such pool and a seated model in a classical gown appropriate to the Italianate setting.&quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-7801618750-72157631647273821", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7801618750/#comment72157631692665205", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1349378489", "_content": "Thank you swanq for adding this interesting connection to the 1910 Childe Hassam painting, &quot;Lilies.&quot;  It's nice to see the garden portrayed in a different medium.", "authorname": "Ryan (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-7801618750-72157631692665205", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "7801618750"}}
