After receiving their marriage license from City Hall, they immediately went to St. Mark's Church where they were married on February 18, 1915. The groom was 40 years old, the bride was 25.\n\nThe bride was the former <b>Mary Mason Hasell</b>, and was a great great-grandaughter of the late Mrs. Mason Jones (&quot;Lady Mary&quot;). She made her d\u00e9but in 1907. &nbsp;In 1908 she married <b>George Borwick</b> of London, heir of Sir Robert Borwick of Cumberland, England. They divorced in February, 1914, after some marital charges and counter-charges in <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F30817FD3C5B13738DDDA90B94DB405B838DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">London courts</a> entertained London society-watchers.

She reportedly will be acting the part of &quot;a society girl with cynical sayings&quot;. Her stage name is to be &quot;Mary Hazel&quot; (her maiden name was Mary Hasell). It was said she met with &quot;much opposition&quot; from her family in going on stage.\n\nWE GIRLS, a comedy in three acts, opened on Broadway, November 9, 1921, at the Forty-eighth Street Theatre.  <i>The New York Times</i> <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A01EFDD1539E133A25753C1A9679D946095D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">review</a> was good.
