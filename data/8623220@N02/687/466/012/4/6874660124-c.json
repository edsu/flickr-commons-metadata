Canby was a trade broker, head of CH Canby &amp; Co., a member of the Chicago Board of Trade and its president c.1913-14. He testified before a number of congressional committees and his name appeared with some regularity in the press regarding wartime trade, grain shortages, etc; the papers did occasionally type C.A.

But given the dearth of info that comes up for &quot;C.A. Canby&quot;, and the fact that the photo before this is of another Chicago grain merchant, C.H. seems like a safe bet.", "authorname": "severinus", "id": "8602872-6874660124-72157629317100148", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6874660124/#comment72157629691673393", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1332987244", "_content": "The Canby from the Board of Trade and Leiter both appeared at the hearing on the fixing of bread prices.
