He felt compelled to paint a grand portrait of the man who helped to establish a free and independent America. In his image, he enshrouds Lafayette with a magnificent sunset. He has positioned Lafayette to the right of three pedestals: one has a bust of Benjamin Franklin, another of George Washington, and the third seems reserved for Lafayette. A peaceful woodland landscape below him symbolized American tranquility and prosperity as it approached the age of fifty. The developing friendship between Morse and Lafayette, and their discussions of the Revolutionary War, affected the artist after his return to New York City.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://inventors.about.com/od/mstartinventors/a/samuel_morse.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">inventors.about.com/od/mstartinventors/a/samuel_morse.htm</a>\nindicates that the portrait was commissioned by New York City.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/artcom/html/tours/visit_guide_collections.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nyc.gov/html/artcom/html/tours/visit_guide_collection...</a>\nindicates that it hangs in City Hall in New York.\n\nNYT of Feb 22, 1916\n  <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30D14F93E5E13738DDDAB0A94DA405B868DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30D14F93E5E13738...</a>\nindicates that it was exhibited in a Lafayette exhibition", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-10870700336-72157637698844694", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "10870700336"}}
