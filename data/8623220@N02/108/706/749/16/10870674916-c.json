This is a detail of the rear center portion of the fountain.  From a contemporary account:\n&quot;The Fountain of El Dorado, by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, tells the story of an Aztec myth of a god whose brilliance is so dazzling that the sun is his veil, and who lives in a darkened temple lest his light destroy humanity. (p. 54.) At the center of the recessed wall are doors of the deity's shaded abode, a guardian on either side. In the friezes naked humanity moves ever onward, striving to reach the home of the god. The figures, in full relief, are splendid in their grace and vigor. Here are men and women whom nothing can hold back; here are those who must be pushed along, some who linger for love, others for worldly goods; but all, the strong and the faint, the eager and the tardy, move forward irresistibly to their destiny.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.books-about-california.com/Pages/The_Jewel_City/The_Jewel_City_Chap_10.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.books-about-california.com/Pages/The_Jewel_City/The_J...</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.books-about-california.com/Pages/The_Jewel_City/Illustrations/The_Jewel_City_Page_054.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.books-about-california.com/Pages/The_Jewel_City/Illus...</a>\nThe complete fountain;\n<a href=\"http://cdn.calisphere.org/data/13030/tt/tf2k4007tt/files/tf2k4007tt-FID4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">cdn.calisphere.org/data/13030/tt/tf2k4007tt/files/tf2k400...</a>\nAccording to many sources, the fountain ended up in Lima, Peru.
