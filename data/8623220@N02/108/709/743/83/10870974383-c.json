During a trip to Europe in 1901, and the resultant exposure to European art museums, reactivated Gertrude\u2019s passion for art. She was particularly interested in sculpture, studied art, and became a sculptress herself. Soon thereafter she became a patron of the arts, promoted the advancement of women in the arts, and organized exhibitions for promising artists. The fountain in the patio of the Pan American building in Washington, D. C. is one of Gertrude\u2019s best known sculptures.\nGertrude\u2019s major and lasting accomplishment of her life was the founding of the Whitney Museum for American Art in 1930. Together with her husband Harry P. Whitney they made a major gift that made it possible for the Whitney Museum of American Art to be established.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/dutch_americans/gertrude-vanderbilt-whitney/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/dutch...</a>\nSee notes under <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/10870645395/\" title=\"Head for &quot;Titanic&quot; (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7312/10870645395_e8fca6caa9.jpg\" width=\"366\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Head for &quot;Titanic&quot; (LOC)\" /></a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-10870974383-72157637705654794", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "10870974383"}}
