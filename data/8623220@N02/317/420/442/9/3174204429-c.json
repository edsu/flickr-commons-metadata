It is still as interesting and a remarkable structure.  Next time we'll have to go inside.  It is also a very special drive to Dalen.

From here, they went over the mountain to Hardangerfjorden, and crossed from Voss to Sognefjorden.\n\nThis was apparently a popular trip among the wealthy at that time. It's mentioned in a book about the history of this hotel. Of course, it is still possible and recommendable to do today.", "authorname": "jonhl", "id": "8602872-3174204429-72157612449879985", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3174204429"}}
