The waterproof part is three layers of birch bark. And to prevent it from flying away, they cut slices of turf and laid over the bark.  The grass was not usually mowed, and goats were not welcome on the roof as they could make holes in the bark with their cloves.  Such a turf roof lasted for about 30 years, then all the turf and soil had to be shuffled down and new birch bark must be put in place. This was done as &quot;dugnad&quot;, a Norwegian expression which means that all the men living around, came together and  did this work without any payment. \nTurf roofs today, used as a decorative element, have solid corrugated plastic plates instead of birch bark.", "authorname": "Atlerom", "id": "8602872-3174206383-72157612592980447", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3174206383/#comment72157612634405601", "realname": "", "path_alias": "tesla314", "author": "16044010@N00", "iconserver": "37", "datecreate": "1232225626", "_content": "Wow, I had no idea of the origin of today's Green Roofs.
