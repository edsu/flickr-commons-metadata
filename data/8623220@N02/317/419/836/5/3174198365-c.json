You can drive by car close to it. If you have time, you might sit down and wait for a while, and if you are lucky, you will see a huge avalanche fall from the glacier at the top, down to the lower one with a lot of noise. This will happen during the day, but no one knows when. An English film photographer waited a whole day, but no avalanche occured. He had just packed all his gear in the car and was ready to drive away, then the avalanche came.", "authorname": "Atlerom", "id": "8602872-3174198365-72157612592095693", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "3174198365"}}
