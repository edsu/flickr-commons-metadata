The old one is from farther north, and in the foreground we have the path built for the postman around 1650. The post route between Oslo (then Christiania) and Bergen usually used a rowboat here, but when bad ice covered the fjord, the postman used the path we can see a part of here in the front. The path ended at the farm Styvi which you just can see in the background as a white dot close to the sea. Farther north, there usually was no ice on the fjord.", "authorname": "Atlerom", "id": "8602872-3174198973-72157612591345781", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "3174198973"}}
