The central\npart of the picture is Eidsfoss locks (UTM32V 144614 N, 47643 E) with the \nold &quot;needle dam&quot; (torn down in the early 1960'ies and replaced with\na modern dam when the third and present hydropower station was\nbuilt in the waterfall, the first constructed during WWI)\nThe nearest buildings in the hillside were built for the workers manning the canal gates in traffic (in Norwegian: slusevokterboligen)  Higher in the hillside (H\u00f8lalia i Stangefjell) is the quarry (for granite blocks for the construction of the canal) freshly visible in the forest.

The forests were owned by the Aall family at Ulefos manor and the cottage was rented to their loggers / crofters.
