It was advertised as a 'new hotel with all modern conveniences', around the time this photograph was taken (1895).  It had 15 rooms (with 25 beds), and boasted &quot;Fishing from the banks of the river&quot; as well as &quot;Horses and Carriages Kept&quot; and &quot;English Spoken&quot;. \n\nThe proprietor was David Tvinde. (Tvinde is apparently also a place name.) The resident hosts in 1910 were Johan W. Furubo, his wife Hildur, and their eight year-old daughter, Alma Marie.
