Its peak marks the border between Sogn og Fjordane and M\u00f8re og Romsdal counties, and rises 1529 meters above sea level.\n\nHornindalsrokken and the Geiranger fjord are 15 km (about 10 miles) apart, so the title &quot;Hornindalsrokken, Geiranger Fjord&quot; is somewhat misleading. &quot;Hornindalsrokken, Nordfjord, Norway&quot; would be better. Nordfjord is one of the fjords of Sogn og Fjordane, and it has given name to the district in the northern part of this county. The valley (municipality) Hornindal is then part of the Nordfjord district.", "authorname": "rafte818", "id": "8602872-3174176867-72157612446026925", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3174176867/#comment72157612608721363", "realname": "Glaucia", "path_alias": "_glaucia_", "author": "21469369@N04", "iconserver": "5456", "datecreate": "1232158503", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/897594@N23/\">Misty Mountains \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 Post 1 - Comment 3</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "_Glaucia_", "id": "8602872-3174176867-72157612608721363", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3174176867/#comment72157615908578974", "realname": "Max Hendel", "path_alias": "haaiah", "author": "21697776@N07", "iconserver": "8471", "datecreate": "1238031125", "_content": "Great shot !!!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/haaiah/3383939342/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3436/3383939342_b6065787c4_t.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"67\" alt=\"IMG_3235\" /></a>", "authorname": "Max Hendel", "id": "8602872-3174176867-72157615908578974", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3174176867/#comment72157622720312393", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "38127572@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1258764968", "_content": "I had a sister-in-law who lived at Sogn og Ford for a while and I recall her telling me that in the winter  that valley was so deep that no sun shone there at all, even though  it was located south of the area responsible for Norway being called The Land of the Midnight Sun.

Well, our farm is actually around 5km away from the mountain, but our mountain farm (s\u00e6ter) is right at the bottom of this mountain. We would spend most of the summers there :-)\n\nThe mountain is NOT situated at the Geirangerfjord. Maybe that piece of information was added, due to many visiting the Geirangerfjord would do roundtrips of the region, (either to Romsdal with Trollstigen in the north or) to Nordfjord in the south. The Nordfjord roundtrip includes the glaciers at Briksdal or Lodal (part of Jostedalen). They would go by cars with chauffeurs, and these trips would take a couple of days, before returning to Geiranger. Many of the tourists around the 1890 came to Geiranger on boats, the early cruise ships. The Nordfjord roundtrip passes  this mountainview, the image is taken from the roadside.\n\nHornindalsrokken is the most southern of the Sunnm\u00f8rsalpane, the mountain area discovered by famous mountaineers such as Patchell, Slingsby, Randers and Mohn in the 1890ies. These mountains surround the Hj\u00f8rundfjord, also a very beautiful fjord, that have had a large share of Norwegian fjord-tourism ever since.\nA little bit about Sunnm\u00f8rsalpene can be found here, but the article is very short in English version...: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnm%C3%B8rsalpene\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnm%C3%B8rsalpene</a>\nMore about Hornindalsrokken here: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornindalsrokken\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornindalsrokken</a>", "authorname": "Fairy Heart \u2665", "id": "8602872-3174176867-72157625098991535", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3174176867/#comment72157625304209088", "realname": "Jeff", "path_alias": "jeff_loc", "author": "34997905@N03", "iconserver": "3319", "datecreate": "1288796091", "_content": "Dear Hulder:\n\nThanks for the correction and the relevant information offered as evidence.
