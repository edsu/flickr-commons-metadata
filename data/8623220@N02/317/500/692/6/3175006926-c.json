The spire from 1625 is shaped as the tails of four dragons twined together. The tower measures 56 meters.\nThe building was restored by Nicolai Eigtved in 1745 and internally renovated in 1855. It housed the Danish stock-market until 1974. In 1918, unemployed anarchists attacked B\u00f8rsen, an attack that went to the Danish history books as &quot;stormen p\u00e5 B\u00f8rsen&quot; (the storm at the stock exchange).</i> (from Wikipedia)", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-3175006926-72157612434360390", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3175006926/#comment72157622524756127", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "43675440@N08", "iconserver": "2535", "datecreate": "1256347002", "_content": "June, 2009.\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/43675440@N08/4038754414/]", "authorname": "ATLNative", "id": "8602872-3175006926-72157622524756127", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3175006926/#comment72157623612754123", "realname": "", "path_alias": "rotscher", "author": "28534052@N04", "iconserver": "8133", "datecreate": "1269987861", "_content": "lovely\n\n--\n<i><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=denmark&amp;page=2\">Found in a search.</a></i> <em>(<a href=\"http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">?</a>)</em>", "authorname": "Roger_T", "id": "8602872-3175006926-72157623612754123", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3175006926/#comment72157623838789322", "realname": "Saad Ali", "path_alias": "mercedesjumbo", "author": "42409234@N04", "iconserver": "4046", "datecreate": "1271081623", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1371547@N20/\">Architectural Techniques</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Mercedes(500SEL)", "id": "8602872-3175006926-72157623838789322", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "3175006926"}}
