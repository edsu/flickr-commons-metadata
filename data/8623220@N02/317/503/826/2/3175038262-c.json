Those are political/administrative units created in 1919. \n\nBack then, most of what is today known as Telemark fylke, was <i>Brattsberg amt</i>, and Buskerud was first <i>Ringerike, Hallingdal, Eiker og Buskeruds amt</i>, and later just <i>Buskerud amt</i>. The name Telemark was used as for a geographical, not political, area. And Kongsberg is no doubt part of Telemark in that sense, just as Grenland is <u>not</u>.\n\nSince Telemark was chosen as the name of the county in 1919, the meaning of Telemark has since shifted towards including Grenland, and excluding Kongsberg. We still have <i>Kongsberg regionsr\u00e5d</i> which includes municipalities in both counties.", "authorname": "Pragmagraphr", "id": "8602872-3175038262-72157624352936666", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "3175038262"}}
