The most visited waterfalls in Norway in many ways. You drive the famous M\u00e5b\u00f8valley and you can visit the waterfall in 30 minutes walk. I would strongly recommend to bring with you a guide to get the dramatic history about the hard way of living here ,the avalanches, roadbuilding and about the Fossli Hotel. Edvard Grieg was here too composing! The surroundings are like Grand Canyon! Waterfall is 182 meeters high! And the bridge is brand new in 2008!\nThe waterfall is still as beautiful as ever! and you can see the rainbow crossing the waterfall between 5 and 7pm\nIf you ever come to NOrway, visit it! Welcome to Eidfjord!\nYou will never forget the place! \nGunn MArit L\u00e6greid, Eidfjord, Norway!", "authorname": "gunnmaritlegreid", "id": "8602872-3175020700-72157612838293694", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3175020700"}}
