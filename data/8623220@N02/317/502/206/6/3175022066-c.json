The first hotel, built in 1885, initially had ten guest rooms, however wings and refurbishments rapidly extended the size of the original  hotel. It was destroyed by fire in 1900. \n\nImmediately rebuilt, the second hotel burnt down in 1902. &nbsp; In 1906, Meinhardt's Hotel in Voss was bought, dismantled and moved to Stalheim.  Sadly, it was lost to fire in 1959, along with loss of life. The current hotel, built in 1960, has 124 guest rooms.
