Oscarshall was sold by King Carl IV to the Norwegian state in 1863, and has been at the disposal of Norwegian kings since.\n\nThe building is considered one of the main neo-Gothic works in Norway. The architectural style is patterned on the English neo-Gothic castle, which was typical in Scandinavia in the mid-19th century. In addition to the main building, the property consists of a park that stretches down to the fjord, where an open pavilion is located.\n\nThe interior was wholly constructed by Norwegian artists and artisans.\n\nThe castle is now closed for restoration, but will open for the public soon.\n\nCurrent spelling is Oscarshall.", "authorname": "Martiis", "id": "8602872-3175011922-72157612439000523", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3175011922/#comment72157612586540435", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "34428100@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1232107694", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/34428100@N04/3200592507/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3499/3200592507_f5ebeca5ae.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" alt=\"  [Oscarshal, Christiania, Norway] 2008\" /></a>\n\nThis is the same view from Skarpsnobrygga, taken 2009.
