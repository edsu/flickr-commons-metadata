Not unlike current times, investors flocked to the project and plunked down their hard earned dollars with visions of a fortune in their future. There was a ceremony for laying the cornerstone on May 26, 1906 with the usual pomp and circumstance. By the end of the year, the foundations were still not laid and investors began to get nervous. So on February 17, 1907 another ceremony was held and the first piece of steel was installed. Promises were made to be 50% complete by May 15th and 100% complete by the end of 1908. By 1908 the fraud was evident, the dream was dashed and there was no government bailout. BUT, we did get some very nice postcards.\n<a href=\"http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/79558\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/79558</a>\n</blockquote>", "authorname": "OakRidge1", "id": "8602872-3798317026-72157621848069125", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3798317026"}}
