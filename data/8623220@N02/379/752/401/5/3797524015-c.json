She entered service in 1905 along with her near-identical sister Caronia.  Of the two, Carmania was equipped with turbines whilst Caronia had the standard engines, an experiment designed to determine how the upcoming Lusitania and Mauretania would be engined.  Carmania was the faster ship.  The experiment was a success and the new liners received turbine engines.  Carmania served as an Armed Merchant Cruiser in World War 1 and has the distinction of being the only liner to engage and sink another liner named Cap Trafalgar in a battle of Trinidad in September 1914.", "authorname": "lornesett", "id": "8602872-3797524015-72157626690281405", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3797524015/#comment72157630720241594", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "67723960@N00", "iconserver": "7429", "datecreate": "1343087243", "_content": "My family came to America arriving in Boston in 1923 on the Carmania.", "authorname": "dennmahoney", "id": "8602872-3797524015-72157630720241594", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "3797524015"}}
