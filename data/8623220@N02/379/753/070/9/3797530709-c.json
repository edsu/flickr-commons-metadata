First named &quot;President,&quot; &quot;Senator&quot; and &quot;Congressman&quot; by Cass Hite, the bridges were renamed &quot;Augusta,&quot; &quot;Caroline&quot; and &quot;Edwin&quot; by later explorer groups. As the park was expanded to protect nearby Puebloan structures, the General Land Office assigned the Hopi names &quot;Sipapu,&quot; &quot;Kachina&quot; and &quot;Owachomo&quot; in 1909. Sipapu means &quot;the place of emergence,&quot; an entryway by which the Hopi believe their ancestors came into this world. Kachina is named for rock art on the bridge that resembles symbols commonly used on kachina dolls. Owachomo means &quot;rock mound,&quot; a feature atop the bridge's east abutment.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-3797530709-72157622195017798", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3797530709"}}
