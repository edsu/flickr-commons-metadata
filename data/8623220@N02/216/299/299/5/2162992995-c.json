She was 5 years old and remembered that the Navy won.  She told us of her father and her grandfather working in a factory with something called a ticker.  There were no telephones and only one means of communication at the factory.  This was available in the event there was an emergency to contact a doctor.  Her father and grandfather went into the office to hear the news of the game.  She said it was the game of the century!  It is amazing how much she remember of those days.  Even at 102 her mind is almost perfect and she is so much fun to talk to.  She can remember every President and their name in order since the age of 5.  It appears that from 5 years on she has pretty much total memory recall.", "authorname": "tlredden", "id": "8602872-2162992995-72157623375603304", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162992995/#comment72157623957321877", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pixelwrangler", "author": "43854658@N00", "iconserver": "5533", "datecreate": "1274128486", "_content": "&quot;SPECULATORS GET TICKETS.; Great Number for Army-Navy Game Are Offered at $10 Each.\n\nNovember 19, 1911, Sunday\n\n&quot;PHILADELPHIA, Penn., Nov. 18. -- George Nitsche, who has charge of the distribution of tickets for the Army-Navy football game, was notified by the police this afternoon that local speculators had obtained large supplies of tickets for the game and are offering choice seats for sale at $10 each.&quot; [purchase price=$2.50] &ndash; <i><a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C00E1DE123AE633A2575AC1A9679D946096D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York Times</a>, Section: Cable News, Wireless and Sporting Sections., Page C6</i>", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-2162992995-72157623957321877", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2162992995"}}
