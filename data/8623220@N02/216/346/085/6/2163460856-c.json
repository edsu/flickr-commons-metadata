Ward Line's 6,207 ton passenger-freighter SS Merida, on May 12, 1911, enroute from Vera Cruz and Havana to New York, was carrying former aristocrats and other refugees escaping the Mexican Revolution of 1910. In a heavy fog, she was rammed amidships by the Admiral Farragut which itself became helplessly disabled. The wireless distress call was sent out and the steamship Hamilton responded. The Hamilton took on board all persons from both distressed vessels before the Merida sank in 210 feet of water approximately 80 miles east / northeast of Virginia Beach, Virginia.\r\nThe rumor of the Merida's treasure goes something like this: there was not enough time to save the $6 million worth of gold and silver from the strong room, and the Maximilian jewels from the purser's safe. There are accounts of salvors working this wreck in 1932 and in the 1980s, but without success.&quot;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.rms-republic.com/other_cargos2.html\">www.rms-republic.com/other_cargos2.html</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-2163460856-72157603728728078", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163460856/#comment72157607239199314", "realname": "Rob Ketcherside", "path_alias": "tigerzombie", "author": "29056926@N02", "iconserver": "3136", "datecreate": "1221196249", "_content": "One of the first uses of <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/history/titanic/sos.asp\">SOS</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.history.navy.mil/library/guides/zcfilelist-lm.htm#l\">Navy Library has the correspondence</a> as it went down.\n\nSeveral articles were run in the Washington Post on May 13-14, 1911, including discussion of the sunken treasure.\n\nShould be obvious, but... photo is older stock image.
