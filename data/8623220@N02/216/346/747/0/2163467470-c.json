There are other Times articles about the boxers  as well: Googling on &quot;boxer Erskine&quot; got me the article I mentioned and two others in the News Archive links at the bottom of the results page. \r\n\r\n&quot;A. Spenceley&quot; might have been either of two A.Spenceleys active in the 1910s to 1920s: Arthur or Alf. I'm guessing they might have been brothers or cousins. <a href=\"http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=217970&amp;cat=boxer\">Here's a page mentioning Arthur Spenceley</a>. Looks as though he went professional, but without success. I can't find an info page for Alf, but an ebay user has or had a postcard photo of him on sale: <a href=\"http://209.85.173.104/search?q=cache:RelgL1l6zjwJ:cgi.ebay.pl/Boxing-postcard-Alf-Spenceley-Light-Weight_W0QQitemZ230060592824QQihZ013QQcategoryZ4094QQcmdZViewItem+&quot;Alf+Spenceley+&quot;&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us\">Here's a Google cache</a> in case the original page is gone.\r\n\r\nIt looks as though most of these boxers are mentioned on <a href=\"http://www.abae.co.uk/Honour/Senior/national/1910/index.asp\">this page</a> of the Amateur Boxing Association of England website. Rube Warnes was middleweight champion in 1910, W.W. Allen was bantamweight champion and A. Spenceley lightweight champion in 1911. R. Erskine lost the featherweight championship title to H. Bowers that same year. Allen appears in every year listed on the page. I haven't yet examined the site beyond the page to which I linked. \r\n\r\nParks doesn't appear at all.
