Well, grand aunt, actually. She was born around1900, so the dates on the photo are probably ten years too early. I had heard she was a swimming champ.

She lived in Scituate, MA at the top of a cliff right on the ocean. She'd have to put down what she was doing in the kitchen, whose window faced the sea, run down a rickety flight of stairs, and jump into the churning water to save some 200-lb guy thirty years her junior! She was always ticked off at being subjected to such a nuisance, as if she had had to go out in the yard to chase off a neighbor's dog or something.\r\n\r\nShe was loads of fun to be around for us kids - though my mum tells me that her jokes tended to get a bit risque!", "authorname": "timcasey75", "id": "8602872-2163467106-72157603825253731", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163467106/#comment72157603911099827", "realname": "Donovan Beeson", "path_alias": "donovan_beeson", "author": "79334698@N00", "iconserver": "3682", "datecreate": "1203012261", "_content": "I love her monogram on the bathing suit.", "authorname": "donovanbeeson", "id": "8602872-2163467106-72157603911099827", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163467106/#comment72157604052620842", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "15746161@N00", "iconserver": "2197", "datecreate": "1204775514", "_content": "timcasey75, thanks for a great comment about your great aunt!
