I do know my donkeys and mules and stand by my comments. I do not say a donkey was  a mule. And yes, on rare occasions a mule will not be sterile but if you think they were used for actual commercial  breeding please provide proof. Since 1527 there have been just over  60 documented cases of foals born to female mules around the world. There are no recorded cases of fertile mule stallions. Non sterile offspring are extremely rare because donkeys have 62 chromosomes, and horses have 64.  As for mammoth, I was strictly referring to mules. As far as extinct goes, species go extinct,  mules are the species E. caballus x E. asinus, that species is not extinct.  There may be variations that can no longer be bred because of certain types of horses  or asses no longer exist but that is not the same thing as extinct in the conventional use I was employed.  I also did not miss, and do not think it appropriate in this forum that you imply a personal attack on me.  That was rather rude.
