Ward for the Hearst Transcontinental Flight, where he would fly the traject New York -  San Francisco. The first who did the transcontinental flight earned the prize allotted by Hearst: $ 50,000. \n\nThe start in New York of Ward was on <b>September 13, 1911</b> where he left at 09:00 hours. So the pictures can be exactly dated.\n\nAccording to the record two man in high places were present Major-General Grant (probably 'another' Grant) and Hudson Maxim (the brother of Hiram Maxim, Hudson Maxim was also an inventor).\n\nRemarkable is the take off picture which was exactly taken when Ward got the machine loose from the ground. In the background is the Statue of Liberty.\n\nAs told Ward came not very far and he abandoned his prize flight around the 22nd of September 1911.   \n\nThe whole occassion was reported on in the NY Times September 13, 1911 and following. The report of the start (giving also the names of Major-General Grant and Hudson Maxim) can be found at <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9402E0D91531E233A25750C1A96F9C946096D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9402E0D91531E2...</a> with the title 'Ward on long flight.
