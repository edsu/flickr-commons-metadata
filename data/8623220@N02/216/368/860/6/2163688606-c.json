This dates the photo to September 13, 1911, the day Jimmie Ward took off from Governors Island in his Curtiss Pusher (named &quot;Hearst Pathfinder&quot;) in pursuit of the William Randolph Hearst Prize, a $50,000 prize to the first aviator to complete a transcontinental flight of the United States within 30 days by October 11, 1911.  Ward's aircraft would suffer an engine failure a three days after this photo.  After repairs, Ward would continue his journey, but would be forced to withdraw after his aircraft was wrecked beyond repair (again, after an engine failure and crash landing) on September 22, 1911.", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "8602872-2163688606-72157622596386565", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163688606/#comment72157622725839386", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1257266798", "_content": "Thanks so much for filling in the picture, TVL 1970.
