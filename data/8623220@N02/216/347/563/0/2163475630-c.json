Sopwith is sitting (or really posing, even in those times people were not really flying in costume !) is the <b>Howard Wright Biplane</b> of 1910. Howard T. Wright was no relation to the Wright brothers. He was an English engineer building flying machines from 1907 on.\nIncomprehensibly Sopwith bought the machine and startled everybody when he made his first test flight on October 22, 1910 without ever having flown !\nMachines were in constant modification, so on the LC picture a structure can be seen in front shielding the aviator from the (cold) wind. Originally the aviator was full blown in the wind.\nAlso can be seen a big fuel tank somewhat behind the pilot. At first a smaller tank was dangerously <b>above</b> the aviator. \nSure this is the machine that landed in Windsor Castle on February 1, 1911, probably not in this configuration on the picture. \nSopwith took this Howard Wright Biplane to the USA in his 1912 trip, but crashed in the water off Manhattan Beach on September 10, 1912. The machine was completely destroyed, but Sopwith lived on to a very old age in the nineties.\n\nSources:\n\nBruce Robertson - Sopwith. The man and his aircraft.
