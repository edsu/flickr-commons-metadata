Suspended by the AAA for a year, Oldfield raced in Mexico for a while, then sold the Benz to his manager, Ernie Moross, announced his retirement, and opened a saloon in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nTo Oldfield\u2019s considerable chagrin, Moross returned the Benz to the beach at Daytona in April 1911. His driver was Bob Burman, as shy as Oldfield was gregarious, but easily as fearless. There were no challengers to the car this time, but still, a large crowd gathered along the measured mile to watch Burman try for a new record.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Here he comes\u2014there he goes!\u2019 summed up the story of the ride in a nutshell,\u201d reported The Horseless Age after the run. Burman\u2019s speed was 141.732 mph\u2014a full ten miles an hour faster than Oldfield\u2019s. This is not to suggest that Burman was the better driver; Barney had typically held back during his Benz run so he could promote another \u201cgo-for-the-record\u201d exhibition. Needless to say, Oldfield was furious and came out of retirement to seek vengeance. But the \u201cfastest speed at which man has ever traveled over the earth\u2019s surface\u201d belonged to Burman for eight years. So phenomenal was 141-plus mph that automobile makers throughout the world were loath to consider building a car to attempt to top it.\r\n\u201cMe and the Benz, here,\u201d said Barney Oldfield, \u201cwe\u2019re gonna warm up the sand a little.\u201d\r\n\r\nResumption of the Florida Speed Carnivals would have been anticlimactic after Burman\u2019s run, so it served as the fitting finale. In 1902, when Olds and Winton were clocked at 57 mph on the beach outside the Ormond Hotel, there had been little motor sport elsewhere in America. Now there was lots\u2014road races in Savannah, Georgia; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Santa Monica, California; Elgin, Illinois; and Fairmount Park in Philadelphia. The first of the board tracks had opened at Playa del Rey in California. And on a new brick speedway in Indianapolis, on Memorial Day weekend in 1911, promoters held a five-hundred-mile race that they promised would be an annual affair.\r\nFrom this article about the Dawn of Speed:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1987/7/1987_7_92.shtml\">www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1987/7/1987...</a>", "authorname": "ngawangchodron", "id": "8602872-2163470598-72157603820377369", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163470598/#comment72157603868635217", "realname": "Craig Zacker", "path_alias": "brokenfence", "author": "16208453@N00", "iconserver": "3679", "datecreate": "1202402663", "_content": "&quot;Bwaaa haaaa haaaa, get out of my way or I will Hypnotize you with my super ray, Hypno-specs!!
