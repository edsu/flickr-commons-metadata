That makes sense given Stimson's term as Secretary of War and Grant's date of death (see below).\n\nGeneral Grant was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Grant\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frederick Dent Grant</a> (May 30, 1850 \u2013 April 12, 1912), the oldest son of Ulysses S. Grant. He died of cancer on Governer's Island just over a year after this photo was taken.\n\nThe man in the top hat escorting Grant was <a href=\"http://www.nndb.com/people/489/000059312/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Henry L. Stimson</a> (1867-1950) appointed Secretary of War in 1911.\n\nHe went on to be Secretary of State, the Governor of the Philippines and again Secretary of War in the 1940's during which he oversaw the Manhattan Project and chiefly influenced Truman to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nGoverner's Island is at the mouth of the East River in New York just across from the much smaller Ellis Island. Below is a lithograph from around the same time (1911):\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/flatbushgardener/458348024/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/207/458348024_0d15a49039_m.jpg\" /></a>", "authorname": "pixeljones", "id": "8602872-2163471766-72157603831224444", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163471766/#comment72157622149232150", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1251294365", "_content": "The occasion for this photo was an annual event on Governors Island, the lawn party of the Army Relief Society. The party was a fundraiser for the organization, which provided succor to widows and orphans of officers and enlisted men of the Regular Army. Pictured here is the 1911 version, which was held on May 25, 1911.\n\nIn response to an email query, Mike Shaver, National Park Service Ranger/Historian at the Governors Island National Monument, provided the date of this event, and also noted that Henry L. Stimson had been appointed Secretary of War only a few weeks earlier, in that same month of May, 1911. Stimson served in the cabinet of President William Howard Taft.\n\nHere is another photo of Stimson with General Grant:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162710703/in/photostream\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162710703/in/p...</a>\n\nHere is a photo of the lawn party, when the excitement was at full tilt:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163472204/in/photostream/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163472204/in/p...</a>\n\nGeneral Grant was the host on this occasion; as Commanding General of the United States Army, Department of the East, he resided on Governor's Island. In fact, he died there, on April 11, 1912.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2163471766-72157622149232150", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163471766/#comment72157622170315500", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anne_loc", "author": "35014516@N03", "iconserver": "3087", "datecreate": "1251492525", "_content": "Wystan: Thanks for the additional information and bringing our attention to the date on the negative.
