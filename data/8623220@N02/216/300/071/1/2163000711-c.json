These guns are designed to sink ships, and they did great damage during the naval incursion attempt of the allied navy on March 18, 1915.  As the label says AFTER bombardment, and that it's written in English and that they could get so close to take this photo strongly suggests the photo was taken during the land campaign during which several points in the Dardanelles peninsula were captured by the allies temporarily.", "authorname": "princewolf", "id": "8602872-2163000711-72157612012125157", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163000711/#comment72157612202727103", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1231274068", "_content": "Hi Princewolf: Thanks for investigating the background to this photo. However, I think it depicts the Italo-Turkish War of 1911 rather than the later Gallipoli Campaign of World War I.  According to The Dictionary of Battles and Sieges (Tony Jaques,  Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, p. 941) in 1911 fighting between the Italian and Turko-Arab forces took place in Sidi Mesri, Libya with the Italians eventually taking over the location.
