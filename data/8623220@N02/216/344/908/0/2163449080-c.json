He was born in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nBradley began his baseball career at the age of 19, in 1897, with the Burlington Colts. He played for the Chicago Orphans, and for 10 years in Cleveland (1901-1910). At the time of this photo he played three seasons with the Toronto Maple Leafs (1911-13). He retired after one season with Brooklyn and one season with the Kansas City Packers.\n\n&quot;Bill Bradley was recognized as one of the best third basemen in baseball prior to 1950, along with Jimmy Collins and Pie Traynor. He led American League third basemen in fielding four times, setting a league record of seven putouts in one game in both 1901 and 1909.&quot; &mdash;<i> [<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=bradle004wil\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>]  [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bradley_(baseball)\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>]</i>", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-2163449080-72157627881863559", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2163449080"}}
