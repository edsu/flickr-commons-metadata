I am trying to ID a cannon presently housed at the El Paso Museum of History (2nd Floor).  It sits on top of a wooden carriage (dark green fading paint) - sorry, I don't know cannon terminology- that measures 73 inches long.  The barrel looks to be made out of iron and measures 301/2 inches long with a 2 inch smooth bore (other end measures 4 1/2 inches in diameter and is closed off).  There are two wooden wagon-style wheels (each w/ 16 spokes) and both are put together in halves (height of each of the wheels is 44 1/4 inches...it looks nothing like the cannon depicted above but is believed to have been used during the Mexican Revolution.
