The boys of the Overbrook Institution, at Overbrook, Penn., came running to a cleared space before the President's chair, each boy in a gymnasium costume.  They gave a gymnasium exhibition...&quot;\n\nFrom the New York Times, April 27, 1911, page 3.  A &quot;Blind Workers' Exhibition&quot; was held in New York at the Manhattan Opera House from April 26-28.  In the evening of the 27th, after opening ceremonies, there was an athletic display.  Winifred Holt was given a commemorative gold medal.\n\nDate matches that written on the photo, but the article's events actually transpired the previous evening, April 26th.  Did the Overbrook boys jump back on a train for Pennsylvania the next day, or stay for the rest of the exhibition?  Was this a photo Bain acquired of them training in Overbrook, and simply dated 4/27/1911 because that's when it was released to the photo service, in order to run with articles about the very popular and notable event?  Was the photo actually taken on 4/27, perhaps in Central Park or some other grassy area of New York?", "authorname": "Rob Ketcherside", "id": "8602872-2162650585-72157620619826802", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162650585/#comment72157623031779874", "realname": "", "path_alias": "xatizon", "author": "32946299@N07", "iconserver": "3159", "datecreate": "1261253424", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1304007@N21/\">FLICKR PARA LA HISTORIA </a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "PINTOR DE SO\u00d1OS", "id": "8602872-2162650585-72157623031779874", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162650585/#comment72157624733834326", "realname": "Elba  Lacerda", "path_alias": "umalouca", "author": "50957289@N06", "iconserver": "5138", "datecreate": "1281924807", "_content": "HA \u00d3 A CARA DOS malandro ahah XD", "authorname": "Elba Lacerda :D", "id": "8602872-2162650585-72157624733834326", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162650585/#comment72157625308643767", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1290300173", "_content": "I started an entry in Wikipedia:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overbrook_School_for_the_Blind\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overbrook_School_for_the_Blind</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-2162650585-72157625308643767", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162650585/#comment72157625759498034", "realname": "", "path_alias": "wznc", "author": "30076447@N07", "iconserver": "3269", "datecreate": "1294298457", "_content": "On your tags you have &quot;dengerous&quot; shouldn't that be &quot;dangerous&quot;?", "authorname": "WZNC", "id": "8602872-2162650585-72157625759498034", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162650585/#comment72157631332886864", "realname": "Sri Rakum Blind School", "path_alias": "rakumblindschool", "author": "81423478@N06", "iconserver": "8016", "datecreate": "1346401128", "_content": "When a person loses one sense their other senses becomes stronger.
