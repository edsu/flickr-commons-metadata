At 130 feet (40 m), it is considered by some the world's first skyscraper and was the first office building to feature passenger elevators. The architects were Arthur Gilman and Edward H. Kendall, with George B. Post as a consulting engineer and hydraulic elevators made by the Elisha Otis company. The building was destroyed by a fire on January 9, 1912.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equitable_Life_Building_(New_York_City)\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equitable_Life_Building_(New_York_C...</a>\n\n\n&quot;", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-2163011401-72157626310429045", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163011401/#comment72157626435245750", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1302019908", "_content": "The note above identifying the building as in Brooklyn is incorrect.
