S. Suffragist leader, and the venerable Dr. Anna Howard Shaw.\n\nMrs. Pankhurst made a return visit to America in October, 1913. On that occasion, foolish U. S. immigration officials decided to bar entry to her, holding her at Ellis Island for deportation. This created a cause celebre, and required the personal intervention of U. S. President Woodrow Wilson to admit her for an already-scheduled lecture tour. The publicity helped suffragist fundraising enormously.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2163792086-72157624569043918", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163792086/#comment72157625300217096", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11773531@N07", "iconserver": "2239", "datecreate": "1288741694", "_content": "Wow!
