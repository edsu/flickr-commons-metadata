For example, if you are on a sports team and forget a piece of equipment the kangaroo court may punish you by making you buy a round of beers. It is generally considered a form of hazing.\n\nIn the picture I can speculate that perhaps the young sailor showed up late for muster and is being publicly ridiculed. Maybe he will be punished by swabbing the deck.
