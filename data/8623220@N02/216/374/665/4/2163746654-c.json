This order to build the first British rigid airship was a direct attempt to compete with the German airship programme..  \n\nStatistics:  \nLength 512ft \nDiameter 46ft \nSpeed  42mph (anticipated) \nEngines 2 x 180hp \nVolume 663, 518cft \nDesigns were already being submitted and on 7th May, 1909 the award was given to the Vickers company. The original contract had been for a ship to be constructed for \u00a335,000, however Vickers advised that they could construct the ship for \u00a328,000 without goldbeaters skin gasbags and varnished skin outer cover. The Admiralty would be required to provide contractors for this work. Vickers also asked if they could put up a constructional shed, free of cost to the Crown, so that they may have a ten year monopoly on airship construction as they did with the submarine boat agreement they had with the Crown. On May 7th the contract was awarded, but the 10 year monopoly clause was refused.\nBy 1910 the British Government had committed themselves to a similar path of air-weapon development to that taken by Germany. It was originally planned that the ship be used for scouting capabilities. The project to build the first ship had begun, and designated &quot;HMA No. 1&quot; or more commonly known as &quot;The Mayfly&quot;. The design team was working on something that could match the current Zeppelins of the time. These could fly 100 miles, carry a crew of 26, and get to 5,400 feet with an endurance of twelve and a half hours.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.aht.ndirect.co.uk/airships/hma1/index.html\">www.aht.ndirect.co.uk/airships/hma1/index.html</a>", "authorname": "Indread Coal", "id": "8602872-2163746654-72157606432448907", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163746654/#comment72157625336690694", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1289188780", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMA_No._1\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMA_No._1</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-2163746654-72157625336690694", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2163746654"}}
