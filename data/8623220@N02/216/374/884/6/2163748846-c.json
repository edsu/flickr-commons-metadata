The Viribus Unitis had an uneventful career spending most of her time in the port of Pula during the war, and never fired a shot in anger against an enemy ship. The most interesting day in her short life was the day she exploded and sank. Italian frogmen snuck up on her in the middle of the night and planted explosives underneath her. She blew up on the morning of 1 Nov 1918; rolled over and sank upside down in the mud of Pula Harbour. She was later partially scrapped from keel to the main deck, but remains are still in Pula harbour.", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-2163748846-72157614476609141", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163748846/#comment72157624366631324", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "48232334@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1277625801", "_content": "I have flown into Trieste airport - my brother lived in nearby Grado, a small seaside resort, for 10 years - un luogo bellissimo e tranquillo!", "authorname": "Blaithin2010", "id": "8602872-2163748846-72157624366631324", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163748846/#comment72157625203568266", "realname": "", "path_alias": "snegulciza7", "author": "54637808@N04", "iconserver": "4084", "datecreate": "1287574590", "_content": "in italian they say &quot;varo della viribus unitis&quot;\nit was on the 4 november 1911\n\n<a href=\"URL\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.misterkappa.it/cvf-rph01.html</a>", "authorname": "snegulciza", "id": "8602872-2163748846-72157625203568266", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163748846/#comment72157625080362543", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1287594499", "_content": "The link in the comment above did not work for me.
