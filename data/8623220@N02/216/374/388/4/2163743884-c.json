It is not Ellis Island \u2013 these particular immigrants have not got as near as that to the goal of their dreams.\r\n\r\nThe strip of &quot;made&quot; land is Hoffman Island, and the hundreds on it are those taken from incoming ships by Dr. Doty, Health Officer of New York, and his busy assistants at the Quarantine station. Some of these \u2013 mostly little children \u2013 have been removed from the ships because of illness; the rest of these on the island are the mothers, brothers, and sisters of these children, who are allowed to remain on the island until their kin get well, and the passengers of incoming ships who have been exposed to infection while in transit and are under observation for signs of disease.\r\n\r\nIt is only within the last year that Hoffman Island has been so populous. Formerly only those under detention used to sojourn there. But exactly a year ago Dr. Doty put through a plan he had long had in mind - namely, to remove at Quarantine all persons on incoming ships found to have contagious diseases. Previous to the introduction of this rule, the Quarantine officials had jurisdiction only over cases of small pox, yellow fever, typhus fever, bubonic plague, and cholera, which will go to Swinburne Island, Hoffman Island's neighbor, a short distance further down the bay.", "authorname": "cabingoddess", "id": "8602872-2163743884-72157603851325634", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2163743884"}}
