The dead sailors were recovered for later burial at Arlington.  Various parts of the wreck were cut up - some became souvenirs, but most of the cutting was done to break up the wreck with the ultimate purpose of making the harbor safe.\r\n\r\nThe barnacle growth seen in the picture makes it likely this pic was taken during this process.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/ussmaine.htm\">www.arlingtoncemetery.net/ussmaine.htm</a>", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "8602872-2162911333-72157604582750310", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2162911333"}}
