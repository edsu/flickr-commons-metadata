Interesting feature of this machine are the small rudders between the wings on left and right.\nThe caption is false, the name of the flyer <b>Beregi</b> is surely the name of <b>Louis Breguet</b> misspelled. The famous designer was early in hs career also a great flyer. \nThe city that is overflown by Louis Breguet looks distinctly Arabic. Maybe a town in Marocco \n\nCheers\n\nKees [aka Varese2002]", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "8602872-2162911031-72157605507692883", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162911031/#comment72157605521207542", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1213041486", "_content": "Thanks for this information.
