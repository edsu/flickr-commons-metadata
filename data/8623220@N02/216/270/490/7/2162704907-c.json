As a respectable upper-class politician, he supplied a center around which opposition to the dictatorship of Porfirio D\u00edaz could coalesce. However, once D\u00edaz was deposed, he proved to be ineffective and the Mexican Revolution quickly spun out of Madero's control. He was deposed and executed by the Porfirista military and his aides, which he neglected to replace with revolutionary supporters. His assassination was followed by the most violent period of the revolution in Mexico (1913\u20131917) until the Constitution of 1917 and revolutionary president Venustiano Carranza achieved some degree of stability. Followers of Madero were known as Maderistas.", "authorname": "Shadrach Christopoulos", "id": "8602872-2162704907-72157626091157856", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162704907/#comment72157626001893405", "realname": "Arden", "path_alias": "arden_loc", "author": "35072786@N08", "iconserver": "3331", "datecreate": "1298554726", "_content": "Shadrach Christopoulos:  Thanks for the detailed information on Francisco Madero.
