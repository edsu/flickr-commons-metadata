The quote below explains why there are so many women in the photo:\r\n\r\n&quot;It may seem strange or ironic that women played such an important role in a party nicknamed the &quot;Bull Moose Party,&quot; but the Progressive or Bull Moose Party welcomed women into leadership positions as no major party had before. The high status of women in the Progressive Party reflected the party's strong advocacy of women's suffrage and women's rights, and the emphasis that Theodore Roosevelt, the party's presidential candidate in 1912, gave to women's issues. Up to this time, no male of Theodore Roosevelt's prominence and popularity had endorsed women's suffrage, and in 1912 neither the Republican candidate, President William Howard Taft, running for reelection, or Democrat Woodrow Wilson, endorsed women's suffrage on the national level. In 1912 women had the vote in several Western states, but in no state east of the Mississippi River.&quot;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/bullmoose.htm\">www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/bullmoose.htm</a>", "authorname": "Catmandu", "id": "8602872-2163955672-72157603783776484", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163955672/#comment72157603787215373", "realname": "Cat to some, Cas to others!", "path_alias": null, "author": "73453775@N00", "iconserver": "1", "datecreate": "1201150505", "_content": "By the way, it was New Zealand who first gave women the vote in the previous century, followed by my home state, South Australia.
