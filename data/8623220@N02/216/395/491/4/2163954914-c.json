You can see his signature in the bottom right hand corner of the document, which is from 1912.\r\n\r\nHere's a brief Wikipedia page about him: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Grantham_Bain\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Grantham_Bain</a>\r\n\r\nI should also mention this page that has information about the Bain collection:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pp/ggbainhtml/ggbaintips.html\">lcweb2.loc.gov/pp/ggbainhtml/ggbaintips.html</a>\r\n\r\nIt contains two GG Bain images that I couldn't find uploaded to Flickr:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ggbain.15074\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ggbain.15074</a> (a photo of GGB undated) and <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ggbain.06606\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ggbain.06606</a> (a caricature of GGB undated).\r\n\r\nNext, comes three photos that are a set:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163811426\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163811426</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163011685\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163011685</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163010885\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163010885</a>\r\n\r\nThey all show the same man (is he GGB? I don't think so) at the same machine.\r\n\r\nThe first of the three shows the machine facing in a particular direction and also shows some menial peering out of a store room at the photographer.\r\n\r\nThe second of the three shows the machine facing in a different direction and no menial. Someone has written across the top of the photo &quot;Printing the Bain News Service photos&quot; and has also written on the machine &quot;Bain-McDonald auto-printer&quot; (could the man in the photos be McDonald perhaps?). There's also an &quot;X&quot; placed over the store room area.\r\n\r\nThe third of the three photos is the second photo again with bits blanked out.\r\n\r\nNext comes <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163507966\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163507966</a>\r\nwhich is a 1910 subscription to GGB's service by a Canadian newspaper.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163813254\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163813254</a>\r\nwhich shows firemen on the roof of the Bain News Service Building in 1912, putting out a fire.

I suspect he had to be fluent in german to get it.\n\nthe license isn't issued by an equivalent to the modern DMV (or KBA in germany) but the local Hamburg police. the stamp with the three turrets, similar to the official sign of the free city, is noteworthy as it has been in use since 1412 until today. I've only seen one other handwritten german document of the time and that's a german passport hanging in the visitor area of the german embassy in new york city. it's dated from a similar or possibly even earlier time and authorizes the document to a gentleman with the expressed purpose of travelling to the united states (aka &quot;Amerika&quot;).", "authorname": "memos to the future", "id": "8602872-2163954914-72157605475884173", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163954914/#comment72157632829128121", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "92958083@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1361572510", "_content": "Is this what the driver licenses still look like in Germany?
