These include one who lives in Hugh's Newport RI house, another who is a local historian at Sewall's Point, FL where Hugh made his summer home, and myself, a cousin several times removed.  Any of us would be pleased to assist you in confirming  to your satisfaction that this is Hugh's Pelican.  I believe the LOC and the SI have several collections with photos and notes on Hugh's work.  I should add that there are more photos in the Newport Historical Society collection and at the Elliot Museum in Stuart, FL.   I am local to DC if it helps, and can be reached at fullerton at comcast dot com.", "authorname": "Wallyf", "id": "8602872-2163727314-72157604123608968", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2163727314"}}
