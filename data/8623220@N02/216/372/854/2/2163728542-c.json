(see next note).  JJ Cole bought a Wright biplane and installed one of his automobile engines for the &quot;Cole Flyer&quot;.\nHere's a little more about the Hearst race:\nIn 1911, the Hearst Transcontinental Flight Derby sponsored a $50,000 prize to the first pilot who completed a transcontinental flight across the United States. The two most noted pilots who attempted this crossing were Calbraith (Cal) P. Rodgers, who took off in his biplane from Sheepshead, New York on September 17, 1911, and Robert C. Fowler, who attempted his flight from the opposite direction, taking off from San Francisco on August 12, 1911, with the hope of reaching Jacksonville, Florida.&quot;\n[Though it seems from Early Aviation's post that Fowler re-started in October)\n<a href=\"http://www.banninglibrarydistrict.org/banning/documents/airports in the san gorgonio pass.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.banninglibrarydistrict.org/banning/documents/airports...</a>\n\nIt's likely that the W.L. (William L. Colt) and &quot;H.S.&quot;(Harry L.) Stratton pictured were the principals of New York's Colt-Stratton Company, an important auto distributor, and perhaps backers of Fowler's flight.  They were in 1912 distributors of the Cole car, and Cole supplied the engine for the plane.\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ibk-N4g_vBgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA264&amp;lpg=RA1-PA264&amp;dq=Colt-Stratton+Cole&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4Q3qHmmNz8&amp;sig=wjhdv9IeNot26Dkkd0sFZSa3wuA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-gwvUNGoM7LlyAGqmIHIDA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Colt-Stratton Cole&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=Ibk-N4g_vBgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA264&amp;a...</a>\n<a href=\"http://earlyaviators.com/efowler1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">earlyaviators.com/efowler1.htm</a>\nAnd J.J.
