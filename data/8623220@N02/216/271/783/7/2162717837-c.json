The photo shows the aftermath of a burst water main on West 129th Street just east of the crossing at Broadway which occurred on June 23rd, so the photo was probably taken later that month. The NY Times reported (&quot;Flood Rages In Manhattan Valley,&quot; June 24, 1911) the loss of 3,000,000 gallons of water from the &quot;city's dwindling supply&quot; and $10- to $15,000 in property damage. The vertical girder to the left holds up the elevated section of the Manhattan Street subway station -- renamed 125th Street Station in 1921 -- of today's #1 line. The front of the white Sheffield Farms building in the central background (built in 1908, and known today as Columbia University's Prentis Hall) is obscured by a frame structure on the triangular block where area locals will recall the Floridita Cuban Restaurant was located until recently and where a gas station is still in operation. To learn more about this fascinating old NYC neighborhood, see my book, &quot;Manhattanville: Old Heart of West Harlem.&quot; Thank you LOC for sharing this pic, which I'd never seen, although I immediately recognized the event.", "authorname": "Eric K.
