Returning from a victorious battle, male warriors would perform the dance in celebration of their success....\r\n\r\nThis dance is now performed at dance competitions and events around the world. It is no longer danced on a shield, but it is still the goal of the dancer to stay in the same spot throughout the dance. The Highland Fling is danced at almost all competition levels, from Primary to Premier. It is also performed for most Highland and Theory examinations. Dancers wear the standard Kilt outfit to perform this dance.&quot;", "authorname": "ww8mgr", "id": "8602872-2162714589-72157603760531125", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162714589/#comment72157603854700627", "realname": "Cathy", "path_alias": "cathy-call-her-blessed", "author": "70897278@N00", "iconserver": "38", "datecreate": "1202181158", "_content": "3637 Girls Frolic Without the Mayor <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A02E1DA1E3EE233A25757C2A9609C946096D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A02E1DA1E3EE2...</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9401EFDE1E39E333A25756C2A9609C946196D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9401EFDE1E39E3...</a>\r\n\r\nThese articles seems to relate to this picture as well as the previous one.", "authorname": "Cathy aka Mom", "id": "8602872-2162714589-72157603854700627", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162714589/#comment72157623332529600", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nataliethegreat", "author": "34387373@N04", "iconserver": "2388", "datecreate": "1265092414", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/22509407@N00/\">Highland Dance</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Juiceboxfairy", "id": "8602872-2162714589-72157623332529600", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162714589/#comment72157624864413430", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1283449106", "_content": "Other Bain/LOC photos taken during the Midsummer Day Festival of the girls of Washington Irving High School, on June 23, 1911, in Bronx Park [corrected on some photos to Pelham Bay Park]:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163520196/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163519956/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162717579/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163516194/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162718041/]\n\nNew York Times story, June 24, 1911:\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A02E1DA1E3EE233A25757C2A9609C946096D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A02E1DA1E3EE2...</a>", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2162714589-72157624864413430", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2162714589"}}
