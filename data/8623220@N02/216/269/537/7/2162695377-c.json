Here's what I learned from the New York Times archive about Captain John Weller, and the fate of his journey: He was a boat builder in Paterson NJ and a member of the Little Falls Rod and Gun Club. His plan was to take his 50 foot motorboat, Romania, from New York up to Newfoundland and then across the Atlantic to Galway Bay in Ireland. His son, Robert Weller was among those on board. They took off mid July, but the boat ran ashore in Halifax July 25. All aboard survived.  A model of the Romania was on view at a Motor Boat Show at Madison Square Garden Feb. 21 to Mar. 4, 1911. Please share any other information you learn about Capt. Weller and the Romania.", "authorname": "Ryan (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-2162695377-72157630517018972", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162695377/#comment72157630762074180", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "82017498@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1343319418", "_content": "Capt Weller made a boat called the Pan-American which made excursions of approx 100 people to Coney Island, but not sure if from Carlstadt Marina to Coney Island or not. Don't know for how long. ALso learned that he had a brother who was a symphony orchestra conductor in Prague.  Still trying to find out about him.  He and his family are on the 1910 census and the 1930 census but not on 1920 census, trying to find out where he was at that time. I have located my mother's cousin in PA, Capt Weller's granddaughter.  Am trying to get more information.  If you find anything else out would appreciate the info.  As soon as I learn more, will do the same.
