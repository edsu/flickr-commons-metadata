Probaly the title &quot;preshtashka&quot; is a typo and it  should be &quot;prestashka&quot; as it appears in a similar Bain negative: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163469184/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163469184/</a>\n\nIt is hard to find information about this word on the Web. A Christian Science Monitor article for Jan. 25, 1911 (subscription database) says of a London horse show: &quot;...the Russian section...will include competitions for a trotter and prestashka in wagon or droshky.  The animals in this class are driven together, but the horse on the near side trots, while the horse on the off side gallops.&quot;\n\nWe will fix the title.", "authorname": "The Library of Congress", "id": "8602872-2162693861-72157622403688440", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162693861/#comment72157623979642972", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1272855135", "_content": "Another photo of Winans in a droshky, pulled by the Prestrashka team:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163469184/]\n\nWinans had a troika team, too:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162668551/in/photostream/]\n\nWinans the Big Game Hunter:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4565507420/in/photostream/]\n\nWinans with more Big Game:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4565505040/]\n\nSitting Bull, an equestrian sculpture by Walter Winans:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162692893/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2162693861-72157623979642972", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162693861/#comment72157623983015232", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1272897663", "_content": "LOC ---------- Your title remains unfixed.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2162693861-72157623983015232", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2162693861"}}
