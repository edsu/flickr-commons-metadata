He was created Duke of Beja. He was the son of Carlos I and Am\u00e9lie of Orleans.\r\nOn 1 February 1908 the royal family returned from the palace of Vila Vi\u00e7osa to Lisbon. They travelled by coach to Almada and from then took a boat to cross the Tagus River and disembarked in Cais do Sodr\u00e9 in central Lisbon. On their way to the royal palace, the carriage with King Carlos I and his family passed through Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o. While crossing the square, shots were fired from the crowd by at least three men: Alfredo Costa, Manuel Bui\u00e7a and Aquilino Ribeiro. The King died immediately; his heir Crown Prince Lu\u00eds Filipe was mortally wounded; Prince Manuel hit in the arm and Queen Am\u00e9lie surprisingly unharmed. It was the quick thinking of Queen Am\u00e9lie that saved her son Manuel. [1]\r\nThe assassins were shot at the spot by members of the bodyguard and later recognized as members of the Portuguese Republican Party. About twenty minutes later, Prince Luis Filipe died and days later, Manuel was acclaimed King of Portugal. The young King, who had not been groomed for kingship, sought to save the fragile position of the Braganza monarchy by dismissing the dictator Jo\u00e3o Franco and his entire cabinet in 1908. The ambitions of the various political parties made Manuel's reign a turbulent one. Free elections were declared in which republicans and socialists won an overwhelming victory. [2]\r\nThe murder of a prominent republican precipated the revolution that had been so long in preparation. [3] Revolution erupted on October 4, 1910. An illegal military coup was commenced by soldiers who were joined by some civilians and municipal guards attacking loyal garrisons and the royal palace, while the guns of a warship added to the revolutionary colonnade. Three days of almost constant street fighting were enough to drive out the young King. [4] Manuel fled on the royal yacht to British ruled Gibraltar.
