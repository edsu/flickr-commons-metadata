The English Dialect Dictionary, published in 1900, describes a &quot;dode&quot; as a &quot;slow [witted] person,&quot; and a scattering of press accounts confirm that Paskert was considered stupid. In 1911, for example, Baseball Magazine's W. A. Phelon grouped Paskert with fellow center fielder Johnny Bates in that regard. &quot;Certain critics declare that there is no choice between Bates and Paskert when it comes to intelligence,&quot; Phelon wrote, &quot;that both of them are crowned with domes of elephant-tusk, and that if either of them ever thought quickly it must have been when deciding whether to take beer or ginger ale.&quot; Whatever its origin, the nickname apparently didn't bother Paskert, who often included the &quot;Dode&quot; in his signature.\r\ncourtesy: <a href=\"http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;bid=946&amp;pid=10926\">bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;bid=946&amp;...</a>", "authorname": "Kayak49", "id": "8602872-2163490216-72157603743539132", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163490216/#comment72157603744062340", "realname": "", "path_alias": "rodspulsepodcast", "author": "77371486@N00", "iconserver": "1107", "datecreate": "1200697274", "_content": "The guy bending down, looks like my bow legged uncle, John &quot;Hans&quot; Lobert, who played for the Phillies from 1911 to 1914.
