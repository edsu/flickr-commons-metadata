Wilson, b. 1886 - d. December 3, 1923) taking off from Governors Island in his Curtiss Pusher biplane (a Curtiss Model D named the &quot;Hearst Pathfinder&quot;) on September 13, 1911, as he started his attempt to win the William Randolph Hearst Prize.  Otherwise known as the &quot;Hearst Transcontinental Prize&quot; or &quot;Hearst Prize&quot;,  $50,000 was offered by William Randolph Hearst in October 1910 to the first aviator to complete a transcontinental flight across the United States in less than 30 days, no later than October 11, 1911.  Jimmie Ward would withdraw from the race nine days later after his aircraft's engine failed, causing it to crash land just west of Addison, New York, suffering damage beyond repair. \n\n Cal Rodgers in his Wright Model EX &quot;Vin Fiz&quot; would also compete for the prize, becoming the first person to complete a transcontinental flight across the United States.  However, Rodgers would fail to win the Hearst Prize because his journey lasted 49 days (September 13-November 5, 1911)", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "8602872-2163541174-72157622720598632", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163541174/#comment72157622725811280", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1257266524", "_content": "Thanks so much for the information TVL 1970.
