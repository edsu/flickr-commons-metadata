The bottle bat made it easier to make contact with the ball, but it did not allow one to hit the ball as far.  The last major leaguer that I recall using a bottle bat was Nellie Fox.  In fact, I have a Louisville Slugger Nelson Fox bottle bat.  Fox got a lot of spray singles using the bottle bat.  He very seldom hit a homer.  Groh played during the &quot;dead ball&quot; era and it was more important to make contact and &quot;hit 'em where they ain't&quot; as Wee Willie Keeler once said.", "authorname": "budderflyman", "id": "8602872-2163818936-72157604066241408", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2163818936"}}
