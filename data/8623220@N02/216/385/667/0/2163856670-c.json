A man hanging on the ropes in a helpless state, with his toes off the ground, shall be considered down. \n\n6. No seconds or any other person to be allowed in the ring during the rounds. \n\n7. Should the contest be stopped by any unavoidable interference, the referee (is) to name the time and place as soon as possible for finishing the contest, to that the match can be won and lost, unless the backers of the men agree to draw the stakes. \n\n8. The gloves to be fair-sized boxing gloves of the best quality and new. \n\n9. Should a glove burst, or come off, it must be replaced to the referee's satisfaction. \n\n10.

The contest in all other respects to be governed by the revised rules of the London Prize Ring.\n\n\nHURRICANE\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=few4kiKjNzw\">www.youtube.com/watch?v=few4kiKjNzw</a>\n\n\nread on and on", "authorname": "Chief Hitting Cloud", "id": "8602872-2163856670-72157612029586474", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2163856670"}}
