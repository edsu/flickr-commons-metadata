He led the Pacific Coast League in runs in 1913 (128), 1914 (127), 1915 (147), and 1919 (127). Also led the PCL in 3B in 1913 (23) and 1915 (14), and hit 20 3B in 1914 to finish one behind the leaders.  Maggert (senior) was considered &quot;temperamental&quot; and &quot;difficult toward managers&quot;.  It was his acceptance of $300 from Babe Borton that led to the investigation into the allegation of games being thrown in the PCL.
