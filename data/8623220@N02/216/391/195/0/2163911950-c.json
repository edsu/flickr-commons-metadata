The Market\r\nwas scrubbed and put into gala array for\r\nthe occasion, and as there was no place\r\nfor musicians on the floor a platform was\r\nbuilt for them up under the roof. Each\r\ndealer also laid in a supply of market\r\nbaskets, and every housewife who made\r\na purchase received one to carry it home\r\nin.\r\n\r\n&quot;As it was a new thing in those days for\r\nwomen to go to market the newspapers\r\nwere delighted to give space to the story,\r\nand the following call to the housewives\r\nreceived wide publicity :\r\n\r\n&quot;Wednesday, April 3, has been declared\r\na public Market Day.\r\n\r\n&quot;Please be at Washington Market between\r\n10 and 12 A. M., to demonstrate\r\nto the City Fathers that the women of\r\nNew York are in earnest in their demand\r\nfor more public markets. The Washington\r\nMarket Association is to welcome us.\r\n\r\n&quot;Spread the news.\r\n\r\n&quot;Secure all the recruits possible.\r\n\r\n&quot;Two thousand women responded to\r\nthis call, the Mayor and Superintendent\r\nof Markets also accepted invitations to\r\nbe present, and the whole place swarmed\r\nwith reporters and photographers.\r\n...\r\n\r\n&quot;Not only was Washington Market Day\r\nthe event of the season locally, but the\r\nfame of it was spread abroad throughout\r\nthe length and breadth of the land and\r\nbecame a large factor in the movement\r\nfor public markets which has since swept\r\nthe country. With the exception of the\r\nbutter boycott, nothing that the League\r\nhas ever done has attracted so much attention.\r\nAll over the country women began\r\nto study the market question, and\r\npersonal marketing became the fashion.&quot;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/housewivesleague00housrich\">www.archive.org/details/housewivesleague00housrich</a>", "authorname": "r.mossman", "id": "8602872-2163911950-72157604166135283", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "2163911950"}}
