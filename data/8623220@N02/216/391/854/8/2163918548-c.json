This neighborhood borders Milton, and is still the location of a commuter rail station where nearby Milton commuters catch the train into Boston.  Lower Mills was also home to the Baker Chocolate Company-- the buildings still stand but it has been made into condos.  Further, the triple (?)-decker  seen in the background may still stand-- multifamily houses are still the predominant form of housing stock in Dorchester.  Ashmont is still a terminus for one section of the current subway system.", "authorname": "She Curmudgeon", "id": "8602872-2163918548-72157603737839127", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163918548/#comment72157603805391321", "realname": "Earl Taylor", "path_alias": "ermmwwt", "author": "23234530@N06", "iconserver": "3191", "datecreate": "1201450044", "_content": "Washington Street does not go near Ashmont Station, so it is perhaps more likely that the trolley would have run down Dorchester Avenue.  If the trolley also passed through Edward Everett Square, it would make sense that the trolley traveled along Dorchester Avenue rather than Washington Street.
