According to the 1930 US census he was married to &quot;Adeliade&quot;, and they married in 1907. In 1930 he listed his job as a &quot;land subdivider&quot; in Santa Barbara, California. In a few more days I can have Adeliade's maiden name if they married in Illinois. I found his son: Earle Kester Ovington (1912-2006) using the census and the Social Security Death index. Too bad we didn't start this a few years earlier and talk to his son. For several other articles in Wikipedia I found the children alive and had them scan photos and send me a copy of the death certificate and I recorded their memories. I interviewed 5 people so far for other entries. I just got his death date from his obituary. See the Wikipedia entry for the new details. I have added them there.\n\nHas the LOC considered setting up an oral history project to go along with these photos?\n\nEarle Lewis Ovington (December 20, 1879 - 1936) was an American aeronautical engineer, aviator and inventor, and served as a lab assistant to Thomas Edison. Ovington piloted the first official airmail flight in the US in 1911, from Garden City, New York to Mineola, New York. He delivered 640 letters and 1,280 postcards, including a letter to himself from the United States Postal Service designating him as &quot;Official Air Mail Pilot #1.&quot;\n\nSource:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earle_Ovington\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earle_Ovington</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-2162738925-72157611490945529", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162738925/#comment72157611568380256", "realname": "", "path_alias": "toots", "author": "61849735@N00", "iconserver": "79", "datecreate": "1230067407", "_content": "Great research.
