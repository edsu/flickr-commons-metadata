Nice photo though, this loco is very difficult to photo unless the light conditions are exactly right in the Great Hall (old roundhouse).\n\nLooking at the running board and splasher designs. The running board has 2 large cut outs, and 2 small ones. The splasher shows the name and you can just make out at least the first letter &quot;A&quot;......; the number 1395 is visible. \n\n'On earlier British locomotives the tops of the wheels usually projected through slots in the running plate and were covered by &quot;splashers&quot; which are analogous to mudguards on a road vehicle.' (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footplate\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footplate</a>)\n\nIt is definately a compound (3rd cylinder), and most likely a 2-2-2-0 &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, as cited above by Stephen Rees. You can just see the top of the LH cylinder below the running board, ahead of the splasher. (See <a href=\"http://www.lnwrs.org.uk/PassLocos/PassLoco.php?loco=05\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.lnwrs.org.uk/PassLocos/PassLoco.php?loco=05</a>  &amp; <a href=\"http://www.lnwrs.org.uk/PassLocos/PassLocoP.php?loco=05&amp;photo=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.lnwrs.org.uk/PassLocos/PassLocoP.php?loco=05&amp;photo=1</a> for comparisons ). Possibly there were some renumberings, before scrappings, given this photo shows #1395?\n\nGiven that the LNWR was amalgamated into the LMS in 1922, ahead of the railway groupings of 1923, there is no signing of any LMS style anywhere in the photo.  The coach on the track alongside also looks as it is LNWR livery.\n\nThe first coach is almost certainly a travelling post office vehicle, with an offset corridor connection, and the rest look similar but with no ducket (lookout). So this is clearly a mail train.", "authorname": "Terry Browne", "id": "8602872-2163530010-72157630799858878", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163530010/#comment72157630823381294", "realname": "CARL SPENCER", "path_alias": null, "author": "82887550@N00", "iconserver": "8059", "datecreate": "1343667590", "_content": "Thanks matey.", "authorname": "CARLOS62", "id": "8602872-2163530010-72157630823381294", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163530010/#comment72157631001233258", "realname": "", "path_alias": "terry_browne", "author": "67908005@N02", "iconserver": "7377", "datecreate": "1344603865", "_content": "This pic shows a restored similar coach at Bressingham Steam &amp; Gardens, (Low Road, Bressingham, Diss, Norfolk, UK) - TPO #9520 : <a href=\"http://zb.mrl.f1p.co.uk/topic/8857068/1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">zb.mrl.f1p.co.uk/topic/8857068/1/</a>", "authorname": "Terry Browne", "id": "8602872-2163530010-72157631001233258", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2163530010"}}
