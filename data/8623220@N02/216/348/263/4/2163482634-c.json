No ethnic group from northwestern Mexico has lived in tipis, ever! A typical, rectangular Yaqui dwelling consisted of wattle-and-daub walls, reinforced by reed canes. \n\nThey were basically a farming people, but many Yaquis supplemented their income from time to time by working as farm hands, fishermen, cowboys, miners or domestic servants in Mexican homes. Thousands of them were persecuted, killed, or deported as slaves to Yucat\u00e1n and Oaxaca by Mexican dictator Porfirio D\u00edaz. Official documents speak of 'cleansing' Sonora by getting rid of all the Yaquis. This genocidal campaign resulted in the 'disappearance' of more than half the Yaqui people. - many of them did not survive the inhumane working conditions on Yucat\u00e1n's henequ\u00e9n plantations. Yet they never gave up their culture and their beliefs... or their land. \n\nMisrepresentation of Native American cultures and people by the media has a long, long history... \n\nThe people standing in front of it look like real Yaquis though, judging by their clothes and looks; they were made to pose in front of the tipi for whatever reason. All the men are wearing dark Yaqui sashes and one of them sports traditional Yaqui sandals, known in Sonora as 'huaraches a tres puntos'. The women wear rebozos  (shawls), popular among Yaquis at the time. This is how most rural women from Sonora were dressed at the turn of the 19th century. \n\nThey seem to be taking part in some larger event, similar to the 1904 World's Fair in St Louis where Geronimo was put on display wearing a stovepipe hat. Many of these exhibitions were virtual human zoos, where visitors could meet 'real-life natives' from different continents - the more exotic, the better, even if this meant using all kinds of incongruous backdrops!\n\nHere is some info on Yaqui history:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.sustainedaction.org/Explorations/history_of_the_yaqui.htm\">www.sustainedaction.org/Explorations/history_of_the_yaqui...</a>", "authorname": "tetabiakti", "id": "8602872-2163482634-72157605661842535", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163482634/#comment72157607498655060", "realname": "jorge cortes", "path_alias": "jorgecortesmx", "author": "12512219@N06", "iconserver": "2824", "datecreate": "1222395565", "_content": "Los indios yaquis formaron el ej\u00e9rcito de Obreg\u00f3n durante la Revoluci\u00f3n Mexicana.", "authorname": "Jorge Cortes Mx", "id": "8602872-2163482634-72157607498655060", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163482634/#comment72157610416379641", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "27370149@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1228019485", "_content": "The Yaqui did however partner up with Apache that lived in the area.
