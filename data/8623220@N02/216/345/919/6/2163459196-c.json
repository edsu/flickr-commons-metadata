As a respectable upper-class politician he supplied a center around which opposition to the dictatorship of Porfirio D\u00edaz could coalesce. However, once D\u00edaz was deposed, the Mexican Revolution quickly spun out of Madero's control. He was deposed and executed by the Porfirista military and his aides that he neglected to replace with revolutionary supporters. His assassination was followed by the most violent period of the revolution (1913\u20131917) until the Constitution of 1917 and revolutionary president Venustiano Carranza achieved some degree of stability. Followers of Madero were known as Maderistas.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_I._Madero\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_I._Madero</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-2163459196-72157625183532385", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163459196/#comment72157629879475958", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1337880911", "_content": "another Bain photo of the hacienda:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162658363/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2082/2162658363_1c307e7cee_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"177\" alt=\"Madero's Hacienda, Bustillo (LOC)\" /></a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-2163459196-72157629879475958", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2163459196"}}
