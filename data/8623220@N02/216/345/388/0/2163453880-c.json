As the struggle grew in intensity, the Structural Ironworkers began a &quot;dynamite campaign&quot; against open-shop employers that led to eighty explosions over the next few years, culminating in in the 1910 conflagration at the open-shop Los Angeles Times building which killed twenty workers.  \r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B02E6DE1F31E233A25756C1A9649C946396D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B02E6DE1F31E233A...</a>", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-2163453880-72157603882233065", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163453880/#comment72157603966573506", "realname": "Pippa", "path_alias": "-diablo-", "author": "72728657@N00", "iconserver": "207", "datecreate": "1203782283", "_content": "And again - thanks swang :)", "authorname": "~Diablo~", "id": "8602872-2163453880-72157603966573506", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163453880/#comment72157604551746381", "realname": "lifeasdaddy ...a guy, his wife, and their son...", "path_alias": "lifeasdaddy", "author": "13267298@N00", "iconserver": "3144", "datecreate": "1208259625", "_content": "This appears also to be related to the McNamara Brothers' case, also considering the juxtapositioning in the collection with photos on the next Flickr page.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.libraries.uc.edu/libraries/arb/exhibits/mcnamara/bio.html\">www.libraries.uc.edu/libraries/arb/exhibits/mcnamara/bio....</a>", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "8602872-2163453880-72157604551746381", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163453880/#comment72157626986757593", "realname": "Joan Hostetler", "path_alias": "heritagephoto", "author": "82522169@N00", "iconserver": "2670", "datecreate": "1309759526", "_content": "Von Spreckelsen's mill stood in the 1200 block of North Street (on the north side of the street between N.
