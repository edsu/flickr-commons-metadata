You were on the right track identifying it as an automatic musical instrument, [bonus points to krseward for knowing what a Violano-Virtuoso is!] and I can supply a perfectly logical explanation (taken from a Peerless coin piano ad, circa 1912):\n\n&quot;Did you ever hear of the London tailor who noticed that when a street piano came under his window and played 'God Save the Queen' the machines of his operators slowed down to keep time with the music?\n  It took him just about a minute to size up the situation.\n  He Hired a man by the day to play good, rollicking, SWIFT [orig. italics] tunes, with the result that the work of his shoproom trebled itself. This was a natural, though unconscious, result, an instinctive compliance with the demand of the musical tempo.\n  Does your enterprise need a stimulant?\n  Give it some PEERLESS [orig. italics] tonic and watch it brace up. The PEERLESS [orig. italics] is a business booster of the Big Bull Moose variety. It will change the entire atmosphere of your establishment and put backbone into the most spineless employee. It will give YOU [orig. italics] an optimistic viewpoint that by natural attraction will induce patronage.&quot;\n\n[etc. etc. and so on]\n\n[note: when I write &quot;orig. italics&quot; in brackets, that means that the proceeding word, in the original ad, is in italics, however I can't do that in this text box so I have substituted all caps instead]\n\nSo, in layman's terms, the people in the weaving shop probably had the orchestrion there to keep people working quickly so they wouldn't fall asleep on the job! Welte orchestrions are not as quiet as a musical box, however they are also not loud enough to be annoying indoors if you are a music lover. I bet the people running the shop had many rolls of fast tunes to get one's blood going and give them the kick to keep working! (fast marches, galops, etc.) Maybe on occasion the boss would be nice and put on a waltz or something so they could work at a more lesiurely pace for a little while!\n\nAnyway, if you are interested in seeing the original Peerless ad, complete with a nice illustration of an early Peerless Elite coin piano with &quot;spade&quot; style art glass, it is reproduced on page 23 of the book &quot;Put Another Nickel In&quot; by Q. David Bowers. (Bonanza Books, 1966). \n\nI highly recommend this book as a great history of coin-pianos and orchestrions in America (with some mention of Europe, and a heavy emphasis on Wurlitzer products), and also of the mechanical music collecting scene, circa 1960s.\n\nFor a larger treatise on the subject, I recommend Mr. Bowers' &quot;Encyclopedia of Automatic Musical Instruments&quot; (Vestal Press, 1972), and for a lavish and fantastic book on the modern-day high-end collecting scene, with lots of color photos, technical information, and a history of the collecting scene plus vivid descriptions of the original places of use of these instruments, I recommend Art Reblitz's &quot;Golden Age of Automatic Musical Instruments&quot; (Mechanical Music Press, 2001).\n\nThank you all for turning me on to this great photo! I just search &quot;orchestrion&quot; and BOOM! there it is!", "authorname": "wackywalks", "id": "8602872-2163450764-72157612999861605", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163450764/#comment72157613606093082", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1234288979", "_content": "I added an entry for Joseph Byron to Wikipedia and will add one on his son Percy Byron later:\n\nPercy Claude Byron (1847 - May 28, 1923), was a London born photographer in Manhattan who created the Byron Company.

First, the same as the other three, is the Blind Workers' Exhibition, April 26-28, 1911.  This could be at the exhibition, or at the home of the Lighthouse for the Blind.  A New York Times article on page 14, 4/30/1911, described that building as being 17 foot wide and 74 foot long.  This photo looks like it could have been taken in a 17 foot wide room.\n\nThe second possibility is that this was run in 1912 around the time that the Bourne Workshop for the Blind was opened -- described in the 1911 article as well as on page 8 of 10/12/1912 when it was dedicated.  The photo would then be a picture at the Lighthouse, portraying the cramped conditions that the Bourne center would alleviate.\n\nI set out to try and determine who might have given the Welte to the NY Association for the Blind, aka Lighthouse for the Blind.
