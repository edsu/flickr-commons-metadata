The train was composed of a cafe\\car, a day coach, a sleeper and observation car.\r\n\r\nIt entered the bridge at a high rate of speed, and was just beginning to increase the speed, when the two last cars were derailed in a manner that seems to mystify railroad men. The first of the derailed cars ran along the ties of a distance of about twenty-five yards. The other swerved to the right and ran to the very edge of the bridge, Another inch, and it would have fallen on the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks and rolled down an embankment into the river.\r\n\r\nThe passengers were thrown into a panic and expected to be carried down to death every minute. The women shrieked and the men ran toward the doors. Some were prevented from jumping out.\r\n\r\nA number were slightly injured by broke glass. Those who needed medical attention: H. SEATON, Bethlehem, Pa., hand cut by jumping through a door. \r\nCHARLES COZSINS, Alletown,[sic] cut about the head. \r\nMISS M. E. COLAMAU, Athena, Pa., hand cut. Negro porter, back wrench.\r\nAll the injured continued their journey.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Post, Washington, DC 13", "authorname": "kerrins_giraffe", "id": "8602872-2163454800-72157603947378406", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163454800/#comment72157623703096525", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1270948392", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1094352@N23/\">sad world</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-2163454800-72157623703096525", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163454800/#comment72157623827622912", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1270948399", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1050819@N21/\">a new world</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-2163454800-72157623827622912", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163454800/#comment72157623827623404", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1270948405", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/591987@N24/\">soulful group</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-2163454800-72157623827623404", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163454800/#comment72157623827623940", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1270948413", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/898180@N25/\">Music,Quotes,Lyrics,etc of the World</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-2163454800-72157623827623940", "iconfarm": 7}], "photo_id": "2163454800"}}
