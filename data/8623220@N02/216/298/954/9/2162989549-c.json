All were renamed on 17 November 1911 so this photo may have been taken prior to that date. I can't find a &quot;Salem&quot; but I wonder if that's really the Salmon, another D class. Subs were all named for fish at the time so &quot;Salem&quot; seems unlikely. Salmon was commissioned in Sept 1910 so that helps to further date the photo.\r\n\r\nThe photo was probably taken at Newport, Rhode Island, as that's where all these subs operated out of.\r\n\r\nSource: Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, via wikipedia.", "authorname": "Jim Rees", "id": "8602872-2162989549-72157603738812137", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162989549/#comment72157603823882143", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1201710577", "_content": "Thanks for the information and your source!
