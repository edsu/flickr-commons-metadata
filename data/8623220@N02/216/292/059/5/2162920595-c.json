The course is named for Chick Evans who in addition to being the first amateur golfer to win both the U.S. Open and the U.S. Amateur Open, founded the Chick Evans Scholarship Program for Caddies. The Chicago River cuts through the center of the course offering beautiful scenery and a formidable obstacle for golfers who play here. The fairways are wide and tree lined, and sand bunkers protect many of the fairways and greens\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_Evans\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_Evans</a>", "authorname": "cabingoddess", "id": "8602872-2162920595-72157603828450898", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2162920595"}}
