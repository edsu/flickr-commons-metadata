This is the day Cal Rodgers took off from Sheepshead Bay, New York at 4:30 pm in pursuit of the Hearst Prize.   \n\nThe Hearst Prize was offered by George Randolph Hearst to the first aviator to fly coast to coast across the United States, in either direction, in fewer than 30 days from start to finish.\n\nRodgers flew a Wright EX Flyer, a modified Model B, named the &quot;Vin Fiz Flyer&quot;.  Vin Fiz was the sponsor of Rodgers and his airplane.  Rodgers would eventually reach Pasadena, California on November 5, 1911, after multiple crashes and mechanical problems throughout his journey.  Rodgers would not win the prize because he exceeded the 30 day requirement, and the prize itself had expired weeks earlier.  However, Rodgers and the Vin Fiz Flyer would be the first to complete a journey coast to coast across the United States.\n\nCalbraith Perry Rodgers\n<a href=\"http://earlyaviators.com/erodgers.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">earlyaviators.com/erodgers.htm</a>", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "8602872-2162926023-72157622751535677", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2162926023"}}
