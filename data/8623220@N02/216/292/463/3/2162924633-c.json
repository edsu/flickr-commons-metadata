It is not Lieutenant &quot;Ellis,&quot; but actually Lieutenant Theodore Gordon Ellyson (USN) (b. 1885 - d. 1928).   &quot;Spuds&quot; Ellyson was designated &quot;Naval Aviator No. 1&quot;.  Given the sequence of photos (see the photos of Helene Dutrieu, Earle Ovington, George W. Beatty, Tom Sopwith, etc.),  and Ellyson's state of dress, I suspect this photograph was taken at the International Aviation Meet at the Nassau Boulevard Aerodrome on Long Island in September 1911.\n\nHere's a flickr photo of Beatty taking off at the meet with Ellyson's hangar in the background:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163726362/sizes/z/in/photostream/]\n\nSee:\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50913FA3D5813738DDDAD0A94D1405B818DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50913FA3D5813738...</a>\n<b>AIR GAME THRILLS AERODROME CROWD; Toy Balloons Elude World's Greatest Aviators at International Meet</b>\n\nWikipedia's entry on Ellyson:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Gordon_Ellyson\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Gordon_Ellyson</a>\n\nHere are a couple of photos of Ellyson from the era posted at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum Archives (on flickr) for comparison:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/4728443747/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/4728443309/]", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "8602872-2162924633-72157625231849699", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162924633/#comment72157625248761293", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1289581071", "_content": "TVL 1970:\n\nThank you very much for providing the proper identity of Mr. Ellyson, and for linking to sources for verification.
