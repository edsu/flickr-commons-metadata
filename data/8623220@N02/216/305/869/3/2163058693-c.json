There's an interesting article by Joyce Kornblugh about the strike here:\n<a href=\"URL\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.lucyparsonsproject.org/iww/kornbluh_bread_roses.html</a>\n\nHere's an excerpt that mentions the children from Lawrence marching in NYC:\n&quot;By far the most dramatic episode of the strike involved sending the strikers' children to sympathetic families in other cities, a measure of strike relief which bad been used in Europe by French and Italian workers. About 120 children left Lawrence on February 10 and were met at the station in New York City by 5000 members of the Italian Socialist Federation and the Socialist Party singing the &quot;Internationale&quot; and &quot;The Marsaillaise.&quot; The youngsters were placed in homes which had been selected by a women's committee of New York sympathizers. Margaret Sanger, later famous for her work in birth control, was one of the nurses who accompanied the children on the train to New York City. She testified before a congressional committee in March: &quot;Out of the 119 children, only four had underwear on ... their outerwear was almost in rags . . . their coats were simply torn to shreds ... and it was the bitterest weather we have had this winter.&quot;\n&quot;A few weeks later, ninety-two more children arrived in New York City and, before going to their temporary foster homes, paraded with banners down Fifth Avenue. &quot;", "authorname": "rebelgal1000", "id": "8602872-2163058693-72157622187673128", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163058693/#comment72157624581212352", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1280097590", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1094352@N23/\">sad world</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-2163058693-72157624581212352", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163058693/#comment72157624581213244", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1280097598", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1050819@N21/\">a new world</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-2163058693-72157624581213244", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163058693/#comment72157624581215466", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1280097618", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/974085@N23/\">The Natural Beauty of Children</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-2163058693-72157624581215466", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163058693/#comment72157624456549779", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peacechild", "author": "56591859@N00", "iconserver": "6037", "datecreate": "1280097642", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/970265@N21/\">Natural Children's Best Pictures</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "onefamousdog", "id": "8602872-2163058693-72157624456549779", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163058693/#comment72157624679189318", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "40662752@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1281273974", "_content": "amazing image", "authorname": "EchoVictorDelta", "id": "8602872-2163058693-72157624679189318", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2163058693"}}
