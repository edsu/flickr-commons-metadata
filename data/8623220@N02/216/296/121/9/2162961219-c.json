The longest-serving manager in Major League Baseball history, he holds records for wins (3,731), losses (3,948), and games managed (7,755), with his victory total being almost 1,000 more than any other manager. He managed the Philadelphia Athletics for the club's first 50 seasons of play before retiring at age 87 following the 1950 season. He was the first manager to win the World Series three times, and is the only manager to win consecutive Series on separate occasions (1910-11, 1929-30); his five Series titles remain the third most by any manager, and his nine American League pennants rank second in league history. However, constant financial struggles forced repeated rebuilding of the roster, and Mack's teams also finished in last place 17 times.\n\nSource:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Alexander_McGillicuddy\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Alexander_McGillicuddy</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-2162961219-72157611550071296", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162961219/#comment72157627585825260", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1315085069", "_content": "Blinded by fate: Connie Mack in the dugout, 1914:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6105954307/in/photostream]\nA couple of later 1914 Bain Agency photos of Connie Mack (10/10/14):\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6219794983/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6220316198/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2162961219-72157627585825260", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2162961219"}}
