She was a pioneer in the field of radioactivity, the first twice-honored Nobel laureate (and still the only one in two different sciences) and the first female professor at the University of Paris.\r\n\r\nShe was born in Warsaw, Congress Poland, Russian Empire, and lived there until she was 24. In 1891 she followed her elder sister to study in Paris, where she obtained her higher degrees and conducted her scientific work. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw. She was the wife of fellow-Nobel-laureate Pierre Curie and the mother of a third Nobel laureate, Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie.", "authorname": "cabingoddess", "id": "8602872-2162969967-72157603891959192", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162969967/#comment72157614463968634", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ilonqua", "author": "9273561@N08", "iconserver": "1392", "datecreate": "1235653356", "_content": "wow, amazing thsi picture is available to see here!", "authorname": "ilonqua", "id": "8602872-2162969967-72157614463968634", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162969967/#comment72157615553151541", "realname": "Diane Downey", "path_alias": null, "author": "28842492@N05", "iconserver": "3084", "datecreate": "1237496048", "_content": "yes it is.", "authorname": "CakesPix", "id": "8602872-2162969967-72157615553151541", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162969967/#comment72157623349407599", "realname": "Grzegorz (Greg) Cinkowski", "path_alias": "cinekg", "author": "33127148@N07", "iconserver": "3262", "datecreate": "1266692149", "_content": "wspaniale zachowane zdj\u0119cie Wielkiego Polaka !", "authorname": "cinekg", "id": "8602872-2162969967-72157623349407599", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162969967/#comment72157625128628158", "realname": "", "path_alias": "lejana", "author": "10252420@N03", "iconserver": "2853", "datecreate": "1286660449", "_content": "simplemente \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/anaypacosancho/2674100706/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3259/2674100706_652586b77b_o.gif\" width=\"72\" height=\"83\" alt=\"apla00\" /></a>", "authorname": "lejana 54", "id": "8602872-2162969967-72157625128628158", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162969967/#comment72157625537478662", "realname": "Carole Axium", "path_alias": null, "author": "13265122@N02", "iconserver": "4034", "datecreate": "1291593155", "_content": "All I can think to say is, amazing.", "authorname": "Caroleaxium", "id": "8602872-2162969967-72157625537478662", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "2162969967"}}
