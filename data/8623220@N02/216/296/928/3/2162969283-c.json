Here are a couple of titles which sounded interesting to me from our catalog. They may be available at a library near you:\n\n1) Main Title: The Greater city, New York, 1898-1948 / edited by Allan Nevins and John A. Krout. \nPublished/Created: Westport, Conn. : Greenwood Press, 1981, c1948. \n<a href=\"http://lccn.loc.gov/81004173\" rel=\"nofollow\">lccn.loc.gov/81004173</a>\n\n2) Main Title: Incredible New York : high life and low life from 1850 to 1950 / Lloyd Morris. \nEdition Information: 1st Syracuse University Press ed. \nPublished/Created: New York : Syracuse University Press, 1996. \n<a href=\"http://lccn.loc.gov/95046297\" rel=\"nofollow\">lccn.loc.gov/95046297</a>\n\nHope this helps.", "authorname": "Jeff (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-2162969283-72157625304417782", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2162969283"}}
