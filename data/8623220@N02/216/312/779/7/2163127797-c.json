Craig had been the pre-Olympic favorite in the 100 meters until beaten by the unknown Howard Drew in the U.S. trials. A leg injury kept Drew from the Olympic finals. By one account there were eight false starts in the finals, three by Craig. In one of them Craig and another sprinter ran the entire distance. Apparently that was just a good warm-up for Craig. When there finally was a clean start, he won the race by two yards. \n\nCraig came back to lead a U.S. sweep of the 200 meters with a time just 1/10th of a second off Archie Hahn's Olympic record. Craig earned three letters in track at U of M, from 1909 to 1911. He never won a Big 10 title, however, as Michigan had withdrawn from the conference during those years. A very successful industrial engineer, Craig later won a spot as an alternate on the 1948 U.S. Olympic yachting team.\n\n<a href=\"http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/olymp2/ol1948.htm\">bentley.umich.edu/athdept/olymp2/ol1948.htm</a>\n\nRalph Craig, double gold medal winner at Stockholm in1912, was an alternate on the yachting team.
