I zoomed in on our TIFF file at <a href=\"hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ggbain.10512\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ggbain.10512</a> and on the top of the ship on the left, it looks like it says &quot;Lucile&quot;. I did a little searching but could find no ship named Lucile that seemed to fit. I did find a ship called Lucile Nowland, that at one time docked at Vicksburg. If anyone can find an image to back that up, or discover another name, we can add that to the record.", "authorname": "Jon (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-2163125627-72157629048564181", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2163125627"}}
