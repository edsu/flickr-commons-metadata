This photo appears to have been taken in 1911 or 1912, around the time of the club's last national championship (the outfits are consistent with those worn in another championship photo from 1911, while the 1908 team was wearing knee-length shorts). \n\nThe handwritten ID on the photograph uses the English spelling &quot;Victoria&quot;.
