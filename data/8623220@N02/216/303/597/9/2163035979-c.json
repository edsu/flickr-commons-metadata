They left Hawaii on February 12, 1012, smothered in leis, heading for the olympic trials.&quot;Accompanying Duke was another Olympic hopeful, the distance swimmer, Vincent &quot;Zen&quot; Genoves, as well as the expedition manager, Lew Henderson, and last minute addition, E.K. &quot;Dude&quot; Miller. &quot;\n100 Years Ago Today - Duke Leaves Hawaii \n\n\nIt was on this day, February 7th, in 1912 that Duke Kahanamoku left Hawaii for the first time. He was on his way to the Olympic Trials on the mainland. Duke had recently smashed swimming records at the Amateur Athletic Union's first swim meet in the Territory of Hawaii and much hope was being placed on sending Duke to the mainland to represent Hawaii.\n\n\n\u201cIt would be a good thing for Hawaii from an advertising standpoint if Kahanamoku were sent to San Francisco to take part in the trials. Win or lose, he can be relied on to make a credible showing\u201d \u2013 H.M. Ayres, sportswriter for The Hawaiian Star, January 4th 1912.\n\n\nDuke and his travelling partners &quot;were literally smothered with leis and were the recipients of countless good wishes from friends and well-wishers.&quot; (Hawaiian Star - February 8th, 1912). Accompanying Duke was another Olympic hopeful, the distance swimmer, Vincent &quot;Zen&quot; Genoves, as well as the expedition manager, Lew Henderson, and last minute addition, E.K. &quot;Dude&quot; Miller. \n&quot;It was decided at the last moment to send Miller along. He knows the boys intimately and can talk Hawaiian, a fact which should be of great help to the expedition as far as Kahanamoku is concerned.&quot;\nIt was Duke's first time leaving the islands.\nPresumably this shot was when they were on the East Coast for Olympic swimming trials there.\n<a href=\"http://americanpaddleboard.blogspot.com/2012/02/100-years-ago-today-duke-leaves-hawaii.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">americanpaddleboard.blogspot.com/2012/02/100-years-ago-to...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-2163035979-72157631133853230", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163035979/#comment72157631133886348", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1345336684", "_content": "see also:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163036243/\" title=\"Lew G.
