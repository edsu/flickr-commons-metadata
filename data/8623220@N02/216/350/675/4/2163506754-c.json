It's a little hard for us to be certain whether or not the image is a mirror view.  I checked with my colleague who works a lot with the negatives and the digital images -- he often uses the way the coats or vests button as a clue as to whether the image has been reversed.   He notes that the vest buttoning would suggest the image is not reversed.  The captioning on the original print and Bain's added caption imply this is correct reading, too.   But you can tell by the tack in the upper left corner of the image that this is a copy of an existing photographic print, and that print could, conceivably, have been reversed.  Alternatively, the article may also have reported it incorrectly, as the left hand could have been injured in the way that you suggest, assuming Dr. Wilson was right-handed.", "authorname": "Barbara (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-2163506754-72157626247829321", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163506754/#comment72157626257897679", "realname": "Jes\u00fas Roberto Duarte", "path_alias": "jesusduarte", "author": "53461717@N08", "iconserver": "4116", "datecreate": "1301437102", "_content": "Does that mean you see also the left hand (depicted in this picture) darker and edematous than right hand?", "authorname": "jerodamor@yahoo.com.mx", "id": "8602872-2163506754-72157626257897679", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "2163506754"}}
