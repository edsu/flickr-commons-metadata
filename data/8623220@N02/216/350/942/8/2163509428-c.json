I doubt any Drum Major would pose for a photograph without wearing the full kit, with spatterdash gaiters (white leggings).

He is not wearing white leather leggings and garters, he's not wearing a Skirt, he's wearing Shoes instead of Boots, and the most obvious fault of all is: although this photo states a Grenadier Drum Major London, he is in fact wearing what I believe to be a Scots Guards crossbelt or Sash, (or it could possibly be a Coldstream Guards one,) and is certainly not wearing a Grenadier Guards Drum Major's Sash!", "authorname": "stinger2965", "id": "8602872-2163509428-72157631127776690", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2163509428"}}
