The current residents of this hacienda are the grandson of the caretaker at the time of the revolution.  BTW, the left portico just collapsed in a rainstorm.  Castillo made the hacienda his headquarters during his time in charge of this area.  It is very close to Pearson, the Mormon colonies and Casas Grandes.
