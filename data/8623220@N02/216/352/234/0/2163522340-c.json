On the right side of the photo is seated famed early aviator J. Clifford Turpin in what is likely a Wright Model B aircraft.  &quot;Lieut. Rogers&quot; is actually at the controls on the left side of the photo and is likely Lieutenant John Rodgers (US Naval Aviator #2).  Rodgers was trained at the Wright School of Aviation in 1911 and flew from Huffman Prairie in Dayton, Ohio at the same time Cliff Turpin was a Wright Company pilot and instructor.  While Rodgers was training at Huffman Prairie, he was visited by his cousin Calbraith &quot;Cal&quot; Perry Rodgers.  Cal Rodgers became interested in aviation and he himself was instructed by the Wright Company and purchased his own aircraft.  Cal Rodgers would become the first aviator to fly from coast to coast (Sept. 17 to Nov. 11, 1911)  in a Wright Model EX Flyer named the &quot;Vin Fiz&quot;.  \n\nCal Rodgers would perish in a plane crash during an exhibition flight over Long Beach, California in April 1912.\n\nLt. John Rodgers would become Commander John Rodgers. Rodgers perished  in 1926 when the aircraft he was piloting plunged into the Delaware River.  Six ships were named in honor of him, his great-grandfather (Commodore John Rodgers) and grandfather (Admiral John Rodgers)  \u2013 USS Rodgers and USS John Rodgers (DD-574, DD-983). John Rodgers Airport (now Honolulu International Airport, HNL) was also named after him (from Wikipedia).
