I wonder what kind of exposure this was as there are so many people with sharp facial features visible. they clearly were not posing (as in holding very still) for any length of time like one would see in older photographs. some female faces do seem to have been &quot;worked over&quot; on the glass negative (or is this a positive?) though. look closely in the large version and you may be able to see what appear to be brushstrokes. I could be mistaken about this as I've only looked at it on flickr.\n\nWhat makes this picture special and rare is that it's showing Andrew Carnegie's full body in direct comparison to others. Carnegie was short and wore high hats and shoes to hide this. David Nasaw writes in his great Carnegie biography about how he would rarely allow to be shot standing and almost never standing next to others so as to not give a hint as to his lack of height. he doesn't seem to be bothered by this shot, making this all the more interesting to me.\n\nthank you for sharing, librarians of congress.", "authorname": "memos to the future", "id": "8602872-2163521986-72157605469729352", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163521986/#comment72157620486926358", "realname": "", "path_alias": "evanesca101", "author": "96684819@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1245875020", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115436@N24/\">1910s Fashion</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "evanesca101", "id": "8602872-2163521986-72157620486926358", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163521986/#comment72157624860512722", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1283398473", "_content": "Old Andy must have forgotten to insert the lifts in his shoes on this occasion:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3121126114/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2163521986-72157624860512722", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2163521986"}}
