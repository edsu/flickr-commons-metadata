However it was fortunate that the outfield seats were a seperate structure so they survived.\r\nEnough of the horshoe shaped foul-line to foul-line, including the full lower deck, had been rebuilt by June 28, 1911, and games resumed there on that date. The upper deck was still being constructed, but was ready for crowds by the start of the World Series (October 14, 1911 that year).", "authorname": "mf52dolphin", "id": "8602872-2163527762-72157603775679432", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2163527762"}}
