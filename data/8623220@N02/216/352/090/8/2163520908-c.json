This playground is on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and Ninety-first Street, and is equipped with swings, sandboxes, teeter boards, slides, basket ball court, and other equipment.\n\n&quot;The opening was not advertised, but there were 200 children on hand when it was opened. The children came from the section immediately east. The association sends play leaders into the tenement sections, organizes the children into guilds and takes them to the ground. Two leaders are in charge at the ground. The association is supported by voluntary contributions.&quot;", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2163520908-72157624863505234", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163520908/#comment72157626091564866", "realname": "", "path_alias": "fieryfurnace", "author": "14350023@N07", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1298174266", "_content": "So what's there now?
