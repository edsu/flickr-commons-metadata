Johnson won that fight and again defended his hard won heavy weight title.\n\nHowever, it was the last time he defended the title in the USA, fighting (and winning) twice in France before losing the crown to Jess Willard in Cuba in 1915. \n\nThis photo could also be considered a mark of the end of Johnson's glory years.  After the Flynn fight he would be forced to move abroad to aviod arrest for various claimed crimes and wouldn't return to the US for 7 years.  His next fight in the US was in prison.", "authorname": "10dasein", "id": "8602872-2163927480-72157623468085017", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163927480/#comment72157628005203759", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1321318020", "_content": "This is one of 4 Bain Collection photos of Jack Johnson taken in the same place and apparently at the same time.
