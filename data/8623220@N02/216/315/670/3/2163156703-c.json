He was born in Co. Galway Ireland, and wrestled in Butte, Montana. He was listed in articles as a British Citizen. He wrestled Ed &quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis on December 3, 1916, and on either January 13, or January 15, 1917 Pat Connolly and Yussif Hussane battled to a 2 1/2 hour draw in Butte, Montana. This information was taken from The Wrestling Datebook, 1915 thru 1920. Pat also wrestled Ed&quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis on November 30, 1916 in Billings, Montana.\n\nOn January 15, 1917, Pat Connolly had a niece born in Boston, MA, and she was to be Christened on January 28, 1917. Pat traveled by railroad to the Christening, and somewhere between Butte and Boston he died on the way. Some say he was poisoned, some say shot, etc. It still remains a mystery.\n\nI am hoping that someone may know of this man, or heard this story. Any help would be very much appreciated.\n\nThank you one and all, Mary &quot; \nPosted 2 months ago.\n\nHe features in the top 75 wrestlers of 1908/09 of vintage cigarette cards .\n\nName Of Set: Pugilists and Wrestlers Second Series (51-75) \nManufacturer: Ogdens \nIssue Year: 1909 \nCard Number: 25 \nCard Titles: Sam McVey, GC O'Kelly, Councillor Peter Wright, Tom Thomas, Jack Johnson, Jack Sullivan, Eugene Vallotton, Jack Sullivan, Ernst Siegfried, W Withers Bain, Pat Connolly, John Lemm, Bill Lang, Bart Connolly, Frank Crozier, Jimmy Britt, Jim Kenrick, Ian Hague, Bill Squires, Henry Irslinger, Lauritz Neilsen, Frank P Slavin, Donald Dinnie, Sam Langford, Frank Gotch, and Al Delmont. \n\n\nNearly two years ago, via genforum.com...\n\nDate: September 29, 2007 at 11:31\n\n'Connelly Pro' wrestler'\n\n&quot;Looking for info' on Pat Connolly of Carna, Galway, Ireland.
