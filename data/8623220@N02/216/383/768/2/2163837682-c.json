Rose Pitonof swam from the New York Yacht Club at the foot of East Twenty-third Street to Coney Island Lightship, a distance of 16-1/4 miles in a straight line, without any noticeable fatigue on her part. The 16 year old girl from Boston accomplished what male swimmers had tried... time and again without success. Rounding Norton's Point, she had a royal battle with the head tide. She made the distance in 5 hours and 8 minutes.\n\nPhoto: Rose Pitonof, Champion Long-Distance Swimmer, Library of Congress, Bain collection\n\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Coney-Island-History-Project/149347545095135?ref=ts\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.facebook.com/pages/Coney-Island-History-Project/14934...</a>", "authorname": "Coney Island History Project", "id": "8602872-2163837682-72157624981925066", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163837682/#comment72157624931000315", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1285712308", "_content": "pennylrichardsca and Coney Island History Project:\n\nThank you for shedding more light on the amazing Rose Pitonof.
