Assuming he batted left handed, this would be the correct position.\nIs there any other info that helps to confirm this is actually an image of Dave Danforth?", "authorname": "harmon_00", "id": "8602872-2163832050-72157608206153724", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163832050/#comment72157608325163196", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1224851027", "_content": "Harmon 00: Thanks for your comment.
