Jack Tower (3rd from left) is my Grandfather! I have some pics from his races (and one of a crash at Indy), but I have never seen this one.\n\nHe raced in the 1911 Indy 500.\nThe results:\nFin: 24, St: 23, Car No. 26, Jackson Automobile,\n\nHe also raced in the 1913 Indy 500.\nThe results:\nFin: 19, St: 25, Car No. 6, Mason Motor: Duesenberg. He crashed and  a broken leg. His mechanic (the mechanic rode in the car as well in those days) had broke ribs and internal injuries. I was told he later died, but I'm not sure.\n\nMy mother told me he set a speed record in one of the time trials, but I don't have that info.\n\nAnyway, my Grandfather raced, worked with many car companies, and did a test drive across the country at one point. He designed some car features. He also wrote poetry, stories, lyrics, and a bit of music.\n\nHe must have been a very interesting man. He passed away, however, before I was born so I never had the pleasure of knowing him.\n\nWonderful surprise to come across this photo.", "authorname": "monta17", "id": "8602872-2162940295-72157623568344243", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162940295/#comment72157625211802061", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1289187708", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Burman\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Burman</a>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Disbrow\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Disbrow</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-2162940295-72157625211802061", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2162940295"}}
