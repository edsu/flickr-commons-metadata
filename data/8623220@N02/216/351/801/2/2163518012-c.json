Fares from New York to Old Point, $8; round trip, $13. The same to Norfolk. To Virginia Beach, $8.50; round trip, $13.50. Hotel rates, $3 to $5 per day. The Old Dominion line dispatches one of its comfortable and commodious ocean-going steamers every week day for these Virginia ports, and the night at sea generally proves a delightful break in the journey.'\r\n\r\nThe trip was clearly popular.  The steamship was one of four that Old Dominion Line extended (or at least planned to) by cutting in half and welding in a forty-two foot section in the middle -- to carry more passengers.\r\n\r\nCUTTING A FLEET IN TWO\r\nDecember 17, 1905, Sunday\r\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9403E4DB153AE733A25754C1A9649D946497D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9403E4DB153AE733A...</a>\r\n\r\nHowever, the journey was not always trouble-free:\r\n\r\nPANIC ON THE PRINCESS ANNE.; Old Dominion Liner Reaches Port Ten Hours Late After Hard Battle Against the Storm.\r\nSeptember 17, 1903, Thursday\r\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F01E7DC173AE733A25754C1A96F9C946297D6CF\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F01E7DC173AE733A...</a>\r\n\r\nJAMES T.
