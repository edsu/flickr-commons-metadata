Also note that the boots are inserted backwards in the stirrups, which in most cases indicates the death of the rider.  Since Gen. F. D. Grant (son of Ullyses S.) died on April 12, 1912, this photo would have been taken a few days later at his funeral most likely.", "authorname": "XSPimages", "id": "8602872-2163892400-72157608627889233", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163892400/#comment72157608888376453", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ladyelita", "author": "21170051@N06", "iconserver": "8117", "datecreate": "1226433619", "_content": "I agree with XSPimages comments. This appears to be a caparisoned horse used during funeral processions to honor the deceased. The boots would be from Gen. Grant himself. \n\nThe tradition can still be requested today for military personnel (colonel or above) who served in the Army or Marine Corp, or served as President of the USA.  A caparisoned horse  was used during Ronald Reagan's funeral. The horse bore the boots worn by Ronald Reagan and was escorted riderless down the procession in honor of the deceased president. \n\nMore information:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/caparisoned.htm\">www.arlingtoncemetery.net/caparisoned.htm</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riderless_horse\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riderless_horse</a>\n\nToo bad this image is fogged.
