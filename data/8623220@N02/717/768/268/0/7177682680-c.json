Many photographs of the German front line were staged. The new manner of waging war with long-range artillery, not to mention the no-man\u2019s-land between opposing trench lines, made photographing battle scenes very difficult. As a result, photographs of still scenes (where exposure times were not an issue) circulated in far higher numbers than shots of active combat. &quot;\n<a href=\"http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=2125\" rel=\"nofollow\">germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=2125</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-7177682680-72157629697640852", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7177682680/#comment72157629743868316", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anne_loc", "author": "35014516@N03", "iconserver": "3087", "datecreate": "1337107289", "_content": "artolog:  Thanks for providing us with more information about the photographer.
