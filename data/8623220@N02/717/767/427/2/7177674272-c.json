He also served as XVI. Corps commander during the latter half of the War. He was Kaiser Wilhelm II's classmate during their student days in Kassel. As War Minister, Wild achieved a certain amount of notoriety when he ordered a census to be taken (Nov 1916) ostensibly to prove that there were relatively few Jewish soldiers serving at the front, and conversely that Jews were over-represented among those registered as physically unfit for military service. There were apparently no significant findings, and the results were thus never published. This action nonetheless unleashed a wave of anti-Semitism within the army, complete with numerous physical attacks.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~jcviser/akb/wild.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">home.comcast.net/~jcviser/akb/wild.htm</a>\n\n\n\nMore on the &quot;Jewish Census&quot; and anti-semitism in the German army:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judenz%c3%a4hlung\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judenz%C3%A4hlung</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-7177674272-72157629726164442", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7177674272/#comment72157629742205820", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "78642357@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1337099661", "_content": "nzomo online", "authorname": "cbk10", "id": "8602872-7177674272-72157629742205820", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7177674272/#comment72157629743411424", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anne_loc", "author": "35014516@N03", "iconserver": "3087", "datecreate": "1337105233", "_content": "rjones0856 and artolog:  Thanks for providing us with von Hohenborn's full name, and additional information.
