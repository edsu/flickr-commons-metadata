At age 13, Daw became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of opera diva <b>Geraldine Farrar</b> appearing in Farrar's film version of <i>Joan the Woman</i> (1916) and several other Cecil B. De Mille-directed productions. \n\n&quot;By the time she was 16, she was leading lady to Douglas Fairbanks Sr. in such films as <i>The Knickerbocker Buckaroo</i> (1918) and <i>His Majesty the American</i> (1919). Her first husband was filmmaker A. Edward Sutherland, who curiously never served as her director. \n\n&quot;Ostensibly retiring from films when sound came in, Marjorie Daw reportedly played bits in a few scattered talkies.&quot;  <i>&mdash; <a href=\"http://movies.nytimes.com/person/17470/Marjorie-Daw\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hal Erickson, Rovi </a></i>\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-8346273460-72157632435601542", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "8346273460"}}
