The tabernacles were comparatively costly to build (although most of the lumber could be salvaged and resold at the end of the meetings), and locals had to put up the money for them in advance. This change in Sunday's operation began to push the finances of the campaign to the fore. At least at first, raising tabernacles provided good public relations for the coming meetings as townspeople joined together in what was effectively a giant barnraising. Sunday built rapport by participating in the process, and the tabernacles were also a status symbol, because they had previously been built only for major evangelists such as Chapman.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Sunday\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Sunday</a>\n\nPhotos of Billy Sunday: \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5084033334/\" title=\"Billy Sunday  (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4085/5084033334_fc6beeda8a_m.jpg\" width=\"174\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Billy Sunday  (LOC)\" /></a>", "authorname": "B-59", "id": "8602872-9473052356-72157635009386116", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9473052356/#comment72157635040818279", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pete_loc", "author": "34911459@N08", "iconserver": "3094", "datecreate": "1376339463", "_content": "B-59 thanks for the background information.
