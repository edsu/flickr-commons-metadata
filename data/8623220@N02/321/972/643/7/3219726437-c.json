A few years after this was taken, WGR Jr. was in WWI as a Red Cross ambulance driver.   He was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1917 for exceptional courage.  He became a law professor at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nHis father William Gorham Rice (1856-1945), ran for Mayor of Albany (1903), ran for Lt. Governor of New York (1914), served as Civil Service Commissioner (appt. 1919).  Was also a world-renowned authority on carillons, apparently.

A noted supporter of Civil Service reform, he had earlier been a member of the United States Civil Service Commission, from 1895 to 1898.

Penny posted while I was digging around the Internet. I can't tell of this photo depicts a youthful guy in his fifties, or an unusually mature-looking guy in his twenties (assuming the photo dates from the early-mid 1910s.)
