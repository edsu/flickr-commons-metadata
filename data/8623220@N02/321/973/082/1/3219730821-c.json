I believe this photo depicts Helen Gould's brother, George Jay Gould I (1864-1923) and his son George Jay Gould II (1888-1935.) Family patriarch Jason &quot;Jay&quot; Gould (1836-1892) named none of his sons Jason, but gave both George and Frank the middle name Jay, so there actually was no Jay Gould, Jr.. George Jay Gould II was sometimes referred to as Jay Gould II.\n\n<b>Correction:</b> The odd Gould nomenclature has tripped me up, too. Jay Gould II (1888-1935) and George Jay Gould II (b 1896) were two different sons of George Jay Gould I. This photo must depict Jay Gould II, since it was taken in 1913 when Jay II would have been about 25, and George Jay II about 17. \n\nOr could this possibly be the two sons, rather than the father and older son? Neither of these guys looks to be pushing fifty.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-3219730821-72157612919520044", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3219730821/#comment72157621916397905", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11572312@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1250292256", "_content": "George Gould (George Senior, son of the robber baron), had two sons, George (George Junior) and Jay (Jay II), and my bet is that these are the brothers in this photo.
