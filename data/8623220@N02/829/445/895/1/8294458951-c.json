It opened in 1868 as the West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway, a cable-hauled line. It ceased operation in 1940. The last section in use, over the Harlem River, was known as the Polo Grounds Shuttle, and was closed in 1958. This portion used the now-removed Putnam Bridge swing bridge and went through a tunnel, complete with partially underground stations.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRT_Ninth_Avenue_Line\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRT_Ninth_Avenue_Line</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-8294458951-72157632308846496", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8294458951/#comment72157632310319950", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1356168739", "_content": "This is taken from the west side of 9th Avenue at 13th st. looking southeast toward Little West 12th St. .
