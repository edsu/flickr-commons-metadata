The liner sank to the bottom of the Atlantic eleven minutes after it was hit. Approximately 175 passengers and 215 crew members survived the German attack.\n\nStella endeavored to keep up the spirits of her companions in one of the crowded lifeboats by singing <i>&quot;It's a long way to Tipperary&quot;</i> to them, along with other patriotic songs &ndash; and she also lent a hand with an oar.\n\nFour years earlier, Stella Carol, whose real name was Lily Furnesse, and her sister were singing Christmas carols on the streets of Hampstead on Christmas Eve, 1910, hoping to get enough money to buy their mother a surprise Christmas present. By a wonderful chance she stopped to sing <i>&quot;Softly the night is sleeping&quot;</i> in the doorway of the well-known teacher of singing,<a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/sherwin-frances-amy-lillian-4574\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Mme. Amy Sherwin</a>.\n\nMadame Sherwin said, &quot;I was much struck by the compass and the purity of the voice of one of the children. I called them in, chatted with them and made them comfortable.  In the intervals of munching an apple, Stella, the elder of the two, told me she was thirteen years of age, one of twelve children, residing with their parents at Holloway.&quot;\n\nThe following day Mme. Sherwin met with Stella's mother, and moved Stella into her home where she was provided with every resource for her education and professional training.\n\nA photo of Mme. Sherwin in the <i>Library of Congress</i> Collection on Flickr can be seen here:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8294458687/\" title=\"Mrs. Amy Sherwin, Lady Maitland  (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8082/8294458687_7a48f20160_t.jpg\" width=\"73\" height=\"100\" alt=\"Mrs. Amy Sherwin, Lady Maitland  (LOC)\" /></a>\n\n<i>&mdash; Compiled and excerpted:</i> <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1915-08-20/ed-1/seq-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <i>New-York Tribune</i></a>; <a href=\"http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19110522-1.2.58.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <i>The Straits Times</i></a>; <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/5484686\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <i>The Advertiser</i></a>; <a href=\"http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=DOM19150824.2.27&amp;l=mi&amp;e=-------100--1101-byDA---0earthquake,+submarine--\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <i>The Dominion</i></a>; <a href=\"http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers 7/New York NY Times/New York NY Times 1915 Aug 15-31 Grayscale/New York NY Times 1915 Aug 15-31 Grayscale (74).pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <i>The New York Times</i></a> \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-8295513146-72157632307711532", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8295513146/#comment72157632309538962", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pixelwrangler", "author": "43854658@N00", "iconserver": "5533", "datecreate": "1356158672", "_content": "A different pose of Stella from this portrait sitting is in the <i>Photographs Collection</i> of  <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw78314/Stella-Carol\" rel=\"nofollow\"> The National Portrait Gallery</a>, London.\n\nThis portrait of Stella Carol was apparently made on February 19, 1915, in the studios formerly of Alexander Bassano on Old Bond Street, London.
