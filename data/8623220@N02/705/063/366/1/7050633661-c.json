He inherited a fortune from his father, who was in the copper business, and spent almost all of it before he died at the age of 34. He was fond of horses and motor sports, getting a very early speeding ticket for $125 in 1907. He was erroneously reported dead in a car crash in 1909. When he died for real in 1917, his estate was reportedly worth $6 million, but on appraisal was found to be less than a tenth that amount.\n\nI've been unable to find news of the couple's arrival in NYC, which apparently happened in 1915. Maybe they sailed in to a different port and went overland.
