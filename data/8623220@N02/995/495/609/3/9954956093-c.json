Preston</b>, also known as John H. Preston, (1860-1938), served in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1890-1894. He was Mayor of Baltimore for two terms from 1911-1919. He was defeated when seeking a third term in 1919, and resumed the practice of law.\n\nPreston graduated from the Law School of the University of Maryland in 1881 with an LL.B. degree. In 1894 he married Miss Helen Fiske Jackson (b.1874), the daughter of Wilbur Fiske Jackson (1849-1903), and niece of Governor Elihu E. Jackson (1837-1907).  They had two sons and three daughters.\n\nMayor Preston was in the national news throughout 1914 as he was the president of the centennial commission directing impressive ceremonies as the people of the United States observed the 100th anniversary of the birth of the immortal anthem, <i>&quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot;</i> From July 8 to August 1, 1914, Commission President Mayor Preston toured dozens of major American cities by rail on a good will, centennial promotional tour.\n\nPresident Wilson and former Presidents Taft and Roosevelt, vice presidents, former Governors of Maryland, the former Mayors of Baltimore along with the present Governors of the eighteen states in the union when Francis Scott Key wrote his national anthem, attended the ceremonies at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, September 6-13, 1914. \n\n6,500 public school children formed a <a href=\"http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5ik1laQMR1qgikbdo1_1280.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">human flag</a> on a special platform built for the occasion, followed by singing of the National Anthem accompanied by a 250 piece marching band. For the rest of their lives many of those children would self-describe themselves as &quot;I was a red stripe&quot; or &quot;I was a white star&quot; as they proudly told of their experience to others.
