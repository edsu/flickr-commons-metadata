Thanks for bringing so much more context to this very minimally captioned image. As you concluded, this is certainly the Harlem River Speedway, also referred to as the Harlem Speedway, and even just The Speedway.  Most of our other <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=harlem speedway\" rel=\"nofollow\">views of the Speedway</a> are not from right on the track like this one, so it's quite a shot!  \n\nComparing this photo to a <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/det.4a17702/\" rel=\"nofollow\">circa 1905 photo of the Speedway</a> gives us a chance to match details, especially when looking at the largest digital TIFF files of each image. (Go <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/ggbain.17246/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for a link to the TIFF file for this image.) Amongst other details which match - like the fixtures along the speedway, the signs and buildings on the opposite shoreline - the most compelling is the distant view in both images of the domed library of the old uptown campus of New York University, designed by Stanford White and built in 1899. (See a <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/det1994005704/PP/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1904 photo of the library</a> from our collections.)  It is now part of Bronx Community College. (For more on the history of this building, read <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/24/realestate/streetscapes-gould-memorial-library-spectacular-interior-designed-stanford-white.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=pm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Christopher Gray's 1996 New York Times article.</a>)\n\nBetween the articles you cite about Denver's track exploits and the script caption up the side of the photograph reading 'Denver coming along Speedway', we can certainly confirm that Denver refers to the horse and that this is the Speedway.  \n\nWe will expand the caption for this photograph when we update.
