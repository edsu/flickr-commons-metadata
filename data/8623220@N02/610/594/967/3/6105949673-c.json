Nathan departed New York City on the afternoon train to Washington, DC, where he met with President Wilson the following day, before traveling on to San Francisco.

His appointment to head Italy's representation in the Pan-American Exposition brought on a boycott of the fair by a number of U.S. Catholic organizations, who denounced him as anti-Catholic.
