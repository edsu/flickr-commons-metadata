Omar your assesment is correct as this is the typical garb worn in Iran by the religous scholars. \n\nOne will note that some of the individuals are wearing black turbans and some are wearing white. The black turbans are a distinction among the scholars as who is a decendent of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) through his daughter Lady Fatimah Zahra (as).\n\nOf the taller individuals in the back wearing fezes, we can make some assumptions that they are either non-clerical individuals or they are Sunni Muslims who are clerics.\n\nOne last comment and hopefully someone can confirm its autheticity, is this photograph was taken at the time of a academic and scholarly debate between the 2 main sects in Islam in the city of Peshawar, Pakistan. The debates themselves were documented in a book known as Peshawar Nights. In a very old copy I have, I found a print of this very picture in that book which is why I believe this picture was taken at that time.", "authorname": "shakir farheen", "id": "8602872-3389732793-72157626063284217", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3389732793/#comment72157626064186225", "realname": "", "path_alias": "oansari", "author": "78327732@N00", "iconserver": "2873", "datecreate": "1299181589", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/shakir_farheen] \nShakir - That is fascinating!
