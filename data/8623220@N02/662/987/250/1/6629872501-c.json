As stronger imaging capabilities become available, we adopt them. But with 1.25 million digitized items today, we don't get to go back too often and re-scan pictures. As a result, you'll find a wide variety of image resolutions representing the LOC collections in Flickr.\n\nFor this WPA poster, the TIFF file on our website is 4.3 MB, which is typical for much of this collection with is 900 posters scanned in the 1990s and 2000. The TIFF for the elephant poster (which was recently re-scanned for a special project) weighs in at 38MB, <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3k00002\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3k00002</a>.  \n\nIt's hard to keep it all straight, so we do document the scanning specification that covers the bulk of a collection.
