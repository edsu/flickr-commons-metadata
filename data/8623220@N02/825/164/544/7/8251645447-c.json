Built at the same time as the Shikishima class battleships, and with virtually identical specifications. However, the Shikishima class vessels had three smokestacks, whereas Asahi had only two, thus giving her a distinctive silhouette. Complement: 836 \n\nThe name Asahi means rising sun, which by extension is a metaphor for Japan.\n\nAsahi was laid down by Clydebank Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding Company, and completed by John Brown &amp; Company. Upon her launch, she was the heaviest battleship yet built on the Clyde. Her delivery in 1900 was delayed when the vessel ran aground as she left for Japan. Stores and ammunition were removed, the ship pulled clear, and after an inspection in drydock she proceeded to Japan, arriving at Yokosuka on 23 Oct 1900.\n\nshe survived all the way into WWII\n\n<a href=\"http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=5173\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=5173</a>", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-8251645447-72157632191496617", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8251645447/#comment72157632205150567", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mambo1935", "author": "79597829@N00", "iconserver": "48", "datecreate": "1355081542", "_content": "grace!", "authorname": "mambo1935", "id": "8602872-8251645447-72157632205150567", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "8251645447"}}
