Position in the newsstream is not an infallible source of dating, though the exceptions I've seen seem to be pictures from the 1920's that have been internumbered with the 1910-1915 shots.\nIn this case, it looks like Campbell made a mistake, as the photo appears in an issue of The Independent, dated October 4, 1915.\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=1rPPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=c.a.%20r.%20campbell&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=1rPPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA17#v=onep...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-8252711412-72157632242947070", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8252711412/#comment72157632282817880", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jon_loc", "author": "63860770@N07", "iconserver": "2794", "datecreate": "1355886771", "_content": "Thanks Richard Arthur Norton, rjones0856, and artolog for the information and links.
