She was built at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal and launched in 1910. The name Kawachi comes from Kawachi Province, now a part of Osaka prefecture.\nKawachi had a sister ship, the Settsu, which had a clipper bow as opposed to the straight bow of the Kawachi.\nAn explosion in the ammunition magazine of the skip sank the Kawachi on 12 July 1918, with the loss of 621 officers and crew.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Kawachi\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Kawachi</a>", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-8252715692-72157632189124729", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "8252715692"}}
