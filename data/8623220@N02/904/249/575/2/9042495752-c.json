The name Kingsgate is related to an incidental landing of Charles II on 30 June 1683 (\u2018gate\u2019 referring to a cliff-gap) though other English monarchs have also used this cove, such as George II in 1748. The building was later the residence of John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury.\nThe building has now been converted into 31 flats.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsgate_Castle\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsgate_Castle</a>\n\nJuly, 2012 Street View:\n<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?q=broadstairs+england,kingsgate+castle&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.383995,1.441269&amp;spn=0.019391,0.077162&amp;sll=51.361384,1.427279&amp;sspn=0.02141,0.038581&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=Kingsgate+Castle,+Joss+Gap+Rd,+Broadstairs+CT10+3PH,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=51.38401,1.441306&amp;panoid=uGF8YFhooldKjWUzjZw9SA&amp;cbp=11,126.72457399999996,,0,-6.405093999999999\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com/maps?q=broadstairs+england,kingsgate+cast...</a>\nMore:\n&quot;2.\ncirca 1760 Lord Holland built a copy of a Welsh Edwardian castle to house his stables.\nThis soon fell into ruin and the large round tower is all that remains of the original\nbuilding.
