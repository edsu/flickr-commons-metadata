He was born in Co. Galway Ireland, and wrestled in Butte, Montana. He was listed in articles as a British Citizen. He wrestled Ed &quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis on December 3, 1916, and on either January 13, or January 15, 1917 Pat Connolly and Yussif Hussane battled to a 2 1/2 hour draw in Butte, Montana. This \ninformation was taken from The Wrestling Datebook, 1915 thru 1920. Pat also wrestled Ed&quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis on November 30, 1916 in Billings, Montana.\n\nOn January 15, 1917, Pat Connolly had a niece born in Boston, MA, and she was to be Christened on January 28, 1917. Pat traveled by railroad to the Christening, and somewhere between Butte and Boston he died on the way. Some say he was poisoned, some say shot, etc. It still remains a mystery.\n\nI am hoping that someone may know of this man, or heard this story. Any help would be very much appreciated.\n\nThank you one and all, Mary", "authorname": "mikescottnz", "id": "8602872-2478428478-72157612624746085", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2478428478"}}
