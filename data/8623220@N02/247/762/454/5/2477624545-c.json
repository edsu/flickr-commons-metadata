Shillcutt</b> patented this machine in US Patent 1,043,473 on November 5, 1912.  Shillcutt is given in the patent as a citizen of the United States, residing in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nIn those times often models were made to give more truth to the patent. The drawings in the patent are remarkably similar to the model presented in the Baines picture.\n\nI think it is safe to date this picture as 1912. \n\nThe machine and probably Shillcutt too are described in the early US aviation periodical <b>Aeronautics: the American magazine of aerial locomotion</b> year 1912, page 179.\n\nInteresting and unique picture probably, but there may be more of them in that Magazine Aeronautics.\n\nCheers\n\nKees", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "8602872-2477624545-72157615900145980", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2477624545/#comment72157615950137642", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anne_loc", "author": "35014516@N03", "iconserver": "3087", "datecreate": "1238108635", "_content": "chakort: Thanks!
