He  may have been the British wrestler William Wood, who won the silver medal in the lightweight (up to 66kgs) division of the freestyle wrestling competition at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Link: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_1908_Summer_Olympics_-_Freestyle_lightweight\">Wikipedia article on 1908 Olympic wrestling</a>.\n\n\nOr maybe he was the Billy Wood who was Britain's middleweight wrestling champion in 1909 (middleweight being at least 76kgs, he'd have had to  pack on quite a bit of weight in a year if William and Billy were the same guy.)

(Billy) Wood, styled &quot;Welterweight Champion of the World&quot; in a book about wrestling published by W. Foulsham &amp; Co. of London sometime around the 1930s? The book, with text by E.J. Harrison, features posed photos of W. Wood and C. Law, illustrating wrestling holds. This book shows up for sale on the Internet in various editions.
