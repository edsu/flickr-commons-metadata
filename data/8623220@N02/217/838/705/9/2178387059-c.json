I grew &quot;on the farm&quot;. It made many transformation over the years with many additions and most of the 'old' buildings torn down. My mother, his daughter , is 89 and living in Jupiter, Fl. The farm was sold probably  30 years ago. By the way, he was not a farmer in Greece. He was studying at a monastery to become a Greek Orthodox priest but was drafted into the army to serve in the Greek-Turkish War where he was wounded. He came to the US through Ellis Island when he was in his teens. He changed his name because it was easier to get a job if your name was Irish sounding. He spoke no English when he arrived and had only ten dollars to his name when he arrived. He was sponsered by a family in Taunton and that is how he came to settle there.  He was quite an individual, a real entrepreneur and owned many different businesses, including a store and a junk yard.\nThank you for the photos. They brought back a flood of old memories and I will show my mother the site when she visits me.\nBetty", "authorname": "bsho", "id": "8602872-2178387059-72157620815910930", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2178387059"}}
