This was pretty common in Puerto Rico before the '50s, especially in the sugar-cane industry.  There is a great example of a CHS in the Central Aguilar Sugar Company.  There were houses, schools, churches, grocery stores, an independent plumbing system, etc. within the grounds of the factory.  They were pretty much independent towns, usually divided between American &quot;whites&quot; and Puerto Rican &quot;blacks&quot;.  In fact, in Aguilar, the American houses were painted white while the Puerto Rican houses were painted gray, to tell them apart.", "authorname": "mparis13", "id": "8602872-2179151730-72157607445130859", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2179151730"}}
