Other rides manufactured by this company were the Loop-O-Plane, Rock-O-Plane, and Fly-O-Plane, amongst others (notice a trend in the names?).  They also built the Octopus, Spider, Monster (still seen at many amusement parks), Sidewinder (updated version of the Roll-O-Plane), Arcoplane, Bulgy-The-Whale, Midge-O-Racer, and Ladybugs rides.  All of their rides, minus the Fly-O-Plane (of which one is still in operation and that's all) and Arcoplane (none left), can still be seen on carnival midways and in amusement parks all over the world.", "authorname": "skywheelrider", "id": "8602872-2178256175-72157616879728369", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178256175/#comment72157626805019634", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "63370585@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1306350238", "_content": "Made by ACME", "authorname": "da_upstart", "id": "8602872-2178256175-72157626805019634", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178256175/#comment72157631982562016", "realname": "Harold Seifert", "path_alias": null, "author": "89839197@N08", "iconserver": "7255", "datecreate": "1352651290", "_content": "very cool!", "authorname": "haroldseifert", "id": "8602872-2178256175-72157631982562016", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178256175/#comment72157632284726015", "realname": "Michael Young", "path_alias": "aka_razz", "author": "74573429@N00", "iconserver": "1291", "datecreate": "1355944606", "_content": "What a range and depth of knowledge.", "authorname": "aka Razz", "id": "8602872-2178256175-72157632284726015", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178256175/#comment72157633880480850", "realname": "Logan Zillmer", "path_alias": "loganzillmer", "author": "23214132@N03", "iconserver": "5332", "datecreate": "1370190176", "_content": "This whole series of photos is incredible.", "authorname": "loganzillmer", "id": "8602872-2178256175-72157633880480850", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2178256175"}}
