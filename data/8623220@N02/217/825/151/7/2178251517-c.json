My hometown! One of the northern states that may get very cold in the winter, BUT atleast we know how to deal with it!

In one winter season, I saw TWO plows and they weren't doing their job...the plows themselves weren't even touching the road! &quot;IF&quot; Nashville were to get the kind of snow like we get up north, they'd be up the creek without a paddle!!!", "authorname": "yucchhiiowwee", "id": "8602872-2178251517-72157625755185193", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178251517/#comment72157626133048930", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51966721@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1298616757", "_content": "Was this Flagg's Pond, before it was reduced to a puddle to build the &quot;new&quot; high school in the late '60s?
