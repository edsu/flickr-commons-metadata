You realize there was no Medicaid back then, no Medicare, and Social Security was in its infancy.  But, rest assured these people had no social security.  They worked for cash.  Nothing more.  There were no birth control pills so women had children when they couldn't afford them.  It wasn't their fault any more than the men with whom they shared private moments.  I doubt anyone ever discussed family planning with them.
