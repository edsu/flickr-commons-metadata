Being a history fanatic, I can't help but wonder if the reaction from the populous back then regarding the switch from the M-3's to the M-4's would be comparable to today's F-22's and F-35's.\n\nCould you imagine trying to aim the whole tank instead of just the turret?", "authorname": "phalanx447", "id": "8602872-2179056437-72157617004358907", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179056437/#comment72157622808624257", "realname": "Oliver Braun", "path_alias": null, "author": "78705066@N00", "iconserver": "55", "datecreate": "1259932881", "_content": "There are also some M3 Stuart light tanks in the background", "authorname": "turkveil", "id": "8602872-2179056437-72157622808624257", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179056437/#comment72157627128002341", "realname": "JW FHB", "path_alias": null, "author": "94141189@N00", "iconserver": "152", "datecreate": "1311308418", "_content": "In the mood of the day, the government was lying to the public, telling everyone that our M3s and M4s were the best tanks in the world.
