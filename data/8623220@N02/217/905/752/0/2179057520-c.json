The smelting technology of that time did not allow the sulfur dioxide generated by the heating of the ore to be captured. By 1909 the mining companies developed new practices which let them recover the sulfur dioxide and use it in the manufacture of sulfuric acid. \n\nReclamation in the Basin began in the 1930's with varying degrees of success initially.  By the 1970's new techniques were developed and today most of the Basin has been revegetated.", "authorname": "Red Necks know stuff", "id": "8602872-2179057520-72157623947193130", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179057520/#comment72157626885012616", "realname": "Pat Henson", "path_alias": "pathenson", "author": "80297647@N00", "iconserver": "7323", "datecreate": "1307221590", "_content": "Not really.
