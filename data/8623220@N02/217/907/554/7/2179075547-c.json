Because of the rapidly-mounting clouds of war in Europe, the UK asked North American Aircraft to design and build a new fighter in only 120 days. The NA-73X prototype was produced in record time, but did not fly until 26 October 1940. The first RAF production models, designated Mustang Mk Is, underwent rigorous testing and evaluation, and it was found that the 1,100-hp Allison engine was well suited for low-altitude tactical reconnaissance, but the engine's power decreased dramatically above an altitude of 12,000 feet, making it a poor choice for air-to-air combat or interception roles. Because of this, the RAF left its eight machine guns intact, but also fitted the Mustang with cameras. In this configuration, it served in at least 23 RAF squadrons, beginning in April 1942.\r\n\r\nThe first Merlin-engine versions appeared in 1943 with the P-51B, of which 1,988 were built in Inglewood, California, and the P-51C, of which 1,750 were built in Dallas, Texas. Both new versions had strengthened fuselages and four wing-mounted 12.7-mm machine guns. Many of these new Mustangs were delivered to the UK as Mustang Mk IIIs, and others went to the USAAF as F-6Cs.\r\n\r\nMore info on the site...", "authorname": "shoupmichaud", "id": "8602872-2179075547-72157604815573389", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179075547/#comment72157604818295565", "realname": "", "path_alias": "szmytke", "author": "18874793@N00", "iconserver": "52", "datecreate": "1209588374", "_content": "I'll expand on why this is a F-6A:\r\nThe production of the NA73 design for the UK had to receive the blessing of the US government before  it could become ratified. A condition of the approval was the supply of two examples to the USAAC for evaluation and these two were delivered and given the designation XP-51. Before that however the US army had already contracted for the procurement of 150 additional aircraft for supply to Britain under Lend-Lease designating these P-51 and these differed from the earlier version by having self sealing tanks and four wing mounted 20mm cannon in place of the eight machine guns. From this batch 93 were supplied to Britain, becoming designated Mustang IA, 55 went to the USAAF as F-6A's, equipped with two K-24 cameras for use in the tactical recon role and the remaining two also went to the USAAF with different engines, initially as XP-78's but later brought into the family as XP-51B's.\r\nThe designation of this aircraft in US service as P-51 came after North American opened the second plant at Dallas, Texas to increase production from the already stretched Inglewood plant which did not occur until 1943 and this image is dated October 1942. In the summer of 1943 the first  P-51B is produced at Inglewood and the identical P-51C is produced from the Dallas plant, operationally their first mission in USAAF service was on Dec 13 1943 when elements of the 8th undertook a long range escort to Keil from the UK", "authorname": "Szmytke", "id": "8602872-2179075547-72157604818295565", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179075547/#comment72157606261789331", "realname": "Really could use some Peanuts", "path_alias": null, "author": "26375439@N03", "iconserver": "3164", "datecreate": "1216500555", "_content": "Would question the title of this photograph - the US supplied other aircraft for RAF use (or at least evaluation).
