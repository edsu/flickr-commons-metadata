The company which was bought by a Russian firm was Rouge Steel, originally part of Ford Motor Company, and is approximately 3 miles from this facility. It's now Severstal Steel. \n\nGreat Lakes Steel (pictured) was in bankruptcy when it was bought by US Steel in 2003, and now known as the &quot;Great Lakes Works&quot;. The plant is currently in operation, with many of the same employees. This photo shows a portion of the ironmaking facility, located on Zug Island. The gas holder was torn down years ago.", "authorname": "vixengal", "id": "8602872-2179116891-72157623490386824", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179116891/#comment72157631622624093", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "73010101@N05", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1348600789", "_content": "My dad worked at Great Lakes Steel from sometime in the 1950's to about early 1970's.
