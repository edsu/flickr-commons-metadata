Here goes...\n\nIt's easy to judge from where we are now, but put yourself in the shoes of the average American circa 1942 when this photo was taken. On December 7th, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. It wasn't a group of radicals or terrorists or extremists, it was Japan. The country. Specifically Japan's Navy, by order of the Emperor himself. On top of that, it was a sneak attack. Through a bungle in communication, it was not seen as a lawful and somewhat &quot;understandable&quot; act of war as intended, but as an evil, vicious, and unprovoked attack that KILLED about 2400 Americans in a few short moments. Over 1100 men died on in the Arizona; most drowned. They're still down there today. The American public was very angry, and very afraid. Fear is a very powerful motivator, and it makes people irrational. Just look at the &quot;bomb scare&quot; incident in Boston in 2007.\n\nAs someone else said above, in 1942 we weren't quite the melting pot we are today, or at the very least, the various cultures of the people of this country weren't nearly as integrated as they are now. As a result, the government reacted in the way it did, mostly out of fear, and I don't blame them for a second. I realize the absurdity of this question, but what would you have done differently? What if the decisions were up to you? What if you have reliable information that said there will be another major attack from within the country? What do you do? Wait for it to happen? How do you protect your people while not infringing upon their rights? Contrary to popular belief, the American government does not set out each day to oppress and/or ruin the lives of it's citizens, no matter what their ethnicity may be, and I'm sure that the INTENT of the interment camps was no different. The results may have strayed, but I still don't blame them. While it's true that the vast majority of Japanese Americans were completely law-abiding upstanding citizens, the FEAR that saboteurs were among them was enough to &quot;require&quot; the camps, and please don't forget that the general public was absolutely in support of not only the camps, but going to war itself, and of using the atomic bombs. Do not be a victim of selective memory. It's not as if there was public outrage at all of this. Nobody lined the streets in protest. No one.\n\nWhile I and everyone else here NOW see that the camps were a mistake, we have the benefit of 50+ years of hindsight. Think about that for a second. 50 years before WWII, people legally kept slaves in this country. SLAVES!! Something else to think about... what happened to Americans in Japan during all of this? Were they put in camps? Or were they killed? Read about Japan's actions in WWII. Since someone remarked above about Guantanamo Bay, what happens to Americans in Iraq or Afghanistan these days? I don't know about you, but I would much rather live in a prison cell or interment camp than have my head cut off and my body burned in the streets. I'm NOT excusing the government or it's actions, I'm just trying to remind everyone to keep things in perspective.\n\nI'm not a republican or a Bush fan in particular, but if he asked the American public in July of 2001 for its approval to deploy a few thousand soldiers to go capture a bad guy named Osama Bin Laden, everyone would have said &quot;Absolutely not! He's all the way over there in Afghanistan! What can he do!?&quot;. If there was a proposal in 1999 to raise taxes to create a better airport security network, everyone would have said &quot;No way! What's the point?&quot; No one wants to do the dirty work or make sacrifices to be safe and free, they just want to be safe and free. Unfortunately, the world does not work that way. That's not America's fault.\n\nBy all means, question the government! Be a good citizen! Keep them honest! I absolutely support that! This is America, and we're SUPPOSED to do that! But don't expect them to never make a mistake. Don't expect them to be perfect. And don't judge them too harshly out of context 50 years after the fact (that goes for Japan too!). Expect them only to do the best they can with what they know, because that's all anyone can do. \n\nSorry for the rant...", "authorname": "space_LION", "id": "8602872-2179117431-72157621994695455", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179117431/#comment72157622124569992", "realname": "hobvias sudoneighm", "path_alias": "striatic", "author": "34427466731@N01", "iconserver": "5341", "datecreate": "1251075988", "_content": "<i>&quot;I'm not a republican or a Bush fan in particular, but if he asked the American public in July of 2001 for its approval to deploy a few thousand soldiers to go capture a bad guy named Osama Bin Laden, everyone would have said &quot;Absolutely not!

Worldwide condemnation and $10 will buy you a movie ticket these days. It doesn't push troops into battle. It doesn't make the gears turn to get things moving. &quot;Lots of people&quot; think what they see on Fox News is the whole story, and &quot;lots of people&quot; voted for John McCain. Unless &quot;lots of people&quot; is a majority vote, it's nothing. So you're wrong.\n\nAlso, you're confusing attacks on US interests as attacks on US soil. There's a difference. German U-boats sinking hundreds of trans-Atlantic ships over the years and planting agents in the USA is tantamount to Bin Laden blowing up embassies over the years and the Taliban destroying statues and treating women poorly. What do we do? We condemn it. We don't act, we say words. Big mean words. We rattle our saber. We wait for the UN to do something. The USS Cole was a military ship operating in hostile waters. It was not American civilians leaping to their deaths on live TV. It was not hijacked commercial flights full of moms and dads and kids disappearing into the side of a building in downtown NYC. \n\nJapan's Navy, acting on orders from Japan's leaders, invaded U.S. territory with a force consisting of 6 carriers and 353 aircraft and attacked a U.S. naval base. They sunk 4 battleships, destroyed 188 aircraft, and sunk or damaged 3 cruisers, 3 destroyers, and 1 minelayer. They killed thousands of people in a few short minutes on American soil, just like Al-Qaeda did on 9/11. Germany never launched a direct assault on America, nor did they inflict nearly the amount of damage or loss of life in a single attack on a U.S. interest. There's a difference. By the way, I'm sure &quot;lots of people&quot; wanted us to go to war after the Lusitania, but what did we do? Nothing. We let our allies in Europe slog it out with Germany for years, and I'm sure &quot;lots of people&quot; wanted us to help them fight, but what did we do? Nothing. &quot;Sorry guys, we're gonna sit this one out. Good luck though.&quot; We did our best to stay out of it until we were attacked by Japan.\n\n19 American soldiers died in Mogadishu in 1993 going after a bad guy that wasn't front page news, and therefore not worth the risk in the eyes of the American public. The men on the ground didn't get AC-130 gunship support which would have been virtually invulnerable in that situation, all because Clinton didn't want it to be a &quot;high profile&quot; operation. Why? Popularity polls. To the president, &quot;lots of people&quot; is the same thing as &quot;lots of voters&quot;. Americans are outraged at going after Saddam, even though he killed 35,000 of his own people and allegedly had more of the same chemical weapons, aka WMDs. But they weren't Americans he killed, right? And he didn't use the WMDs on us yet, right? So who cares? It must just be about oil, I guess...\n\nThe catch 22 of unconventional warfare is that the average citizen never hears about the successes, only the failures. The modern American public wants results without sacrifice, but that's not the kind of world we live in. The president has to make decisions every day that put men and women in harm's way and will be scrutinized for years and years to come. People will frown upon the A-bomb and interment camps and GITMO and Mogadishu and Viet Nam and the Bay of Pigs for centuries, but if you have a better solution, by all means, propose one.\n\nIt's December 8th, 1941 - Pearl Harbor is still burning, there are some 2000 bodies tallied so far and more still in the water, and there are doomed sailors trapped and still alive in the Arizona, tapping on the hull and waiting for a rescue that will never come, all from a sneak attack by Japan's Navy.

\nrounded up and placed in the internment camps \nThat simply did not happen --\n\nThat is <em>not</em> to say that many Asian-Americans did not face prejudice, unjustified anger and persecution from others at the time, as many people &quot;mistook&quot; other Asian-Americans for being Japanese- Americans, and took out their misguided urges of  hatred, retaliation and revenge on these people --\nAnd that is also <em>not</em> to say that it would have been justified, in any way, for them to be behaving the same way towards\nJapanese-Americans at the time, either...\n( as, unfortunately, that also did happen ) =\nMy own feeling in this matter is that it was on acount of &quot;fear&quot; that the Interment Camp order was hustled through, but it was an\nirrational fear, to be certain...\n\nOf course there had already been perpertrated racism against\n Asian-Americans, in general, long before WWII \n( both on the Institutional level and also by the &quot;general public&quot; ) \nbut in the case of the internment camps,\nthat mistake arose out of the erroneous assumption that there \ncould be no difference with &quot;The Japanese&quot; \nand &quot;Japanese Americans&quot; -\nPeople just couldn't seem to get it through their heads that \nthe Japanese-Americans really <em>wanted</em> to be just as \n&quot;American&quot; as anyone else, that the US was now their adopted country, and that they were loyal to what was now their new homeland, and not to the government back in the &quot;Old Country&quot; ---\n\nA lot of this misconception did come about because of the stereotypes of Asian-Americans that were perpetrated in the popular culture of the day - ( Movies, Radio, pulp fiction, etc -)\nwhere &quot;Oriental Villains&quot; were sadistic, cunning and cruel, \n&quot;Inscrutable&quot; Chinese people always quoted from Confucious and said things like:\n&quot;Honorable Sir&quot; &amp; etc  - but also mainly where Asians were treated in general like some sort of otherwordly, mysterious and exotic race...\n\nAnd because there were simply <em>not</em> as many Asians living in the country at the time ( due, in great deal, to the exclusionary immigration laws that had been put in place years before, with the express purpose of severely limiting the number of Asians who could even enter the country to a bare minimum )\nmany average Americans throughout much of the country never even came into contact with real-live Asians, so they got their ideas about what Asians were all about from these sensationalized sources...\n\nAnyway, in the general public's mind's eye ( at the start of WWII )\nA lot of people just couldn't comprehend that all the \nJapanese-American citizens now in our country were not all going to be rushing down into their basements, getting on their short-wave radio sets and sending secret code messages back to Japan\nfilled with vital information for the Japanese Military --\nThe whole thing is stupid and absurd, of course,  \nbut I think that was the prevailing mentality at the time -\n( &quot;...Paranoia runs deep...Into your life it will creep...&quot; )\n\nAnd that is not to say, either, that their weren't those who didn't take huge unfair advantages of the situation when the Japanese-Americans were being rounded up and evacuated to the camps -\nStealing property &amp; taking businesses, and so on...\n\nOf course the smiles are all forced - they were never happy to be there, \nof course - it was a trial of humilation and great sorrow for them...\nBut no, the internment camps were <em>not</em> Auschwitz or \nDachau, either, they were not death camps, even if they were\nconcentration camps, there was no torture going on, no gruesome and horrible medical &quot;experiments&quot;, &amp; no starvation or slave labor, etcetera...\n\nAnd there were also a prevailing attitude among many of the Japanese-Americans in the camps that they had no choice but to to &quot;grin and bear it&quot; - to make the best of a lousy situation,  simply in order ( if nothing else ) to maintain sanity and self-respect, so they continued to have interests and keep themselves occupied, to keep up at least a &quot;sense of normalcy&quot; in their day-to-day lives, and to maintain a sense of community inside the confines of the camp, although of course they must have bitterly resented being ostracized from society at large -\nmore than anything, I believe they felt deeply hurt, and betrayed \nby what the government had done to them...\n\nAlso, yes, the Nazis did use this kind of propaganda when showing the outside world their lies about just how the Jews were being treated in their camps - in fact, they went a great deal further than this, they once set up an entire phony village-like enclave, filled it with\n&quot;happy-go-lucky&quot; Jews, and filmed their little propaganda film to show that this what was the way the Jews were being treated - like they had all been sent off to resort communities, ( &quot;Seperate, but Equal&quot; ) when, of course, the truth was 180 degrees in the opposite direction...\n\nI'm not sure if we really learned enough from the mistakes of the \n1940's, however - witness, in the aftermath of 9/11, close to a hysteria against Americans who ethnic background was from the \nNear East - sporadic hate crimes, and, again, on account of \n&quot;unfamiliarity&quot; with other peoples and cultures, the lumping together of many different kinds of people from different countries and different cultures into the same bag -\nAn obvious example being the hate-motivated attacks that came against Americans who came from the Indian Sikh tradition - their traditional turbans being confused with the kind worn by one \nMr Osama Bin Ladn...\n\nI also believe many Americans came under the false impression that in all the Muslim mosques all over the country, there were plots against America being hatched, and that they were all, ( more likely than not ) in league with, and reporting to the terrorists &quot;back home&quot;\n( in the same way people had that cock-eyed idea about the \nJapanese Americans doing the same back in WWII ) --\n\nI think just maybe, if there had not been the concerted effort , previously, to bring to light the injustice and just plain wrongness of the Internment Camps of WWII, there might have been a move \n( after 9/11) to start talking in terms of &quot;rounding up&quot; vast numbers of Americans of the Muslim faith and/or with Near-Eastern backgrounds and &quot;evacuating&quot; them to &quot;Internment Camps&quot; ? I believe we came a lot closer to a situation at least along those lines than we like to admit, in the aftermath of the horrible shock of 9/11, and in the confusion, panic and fear, \nno matter what Mr Bush may have been saying at the time abou thow  it was not right to &quot;single out&quot; Muslim-Americans and Americans who had immigrated from the Near-East ...=", "authorname": "Frabjous Joy", "id": "8602872-2179117431-72157622766701520", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179117431/#comment72157624860670228", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "50274688@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1283400535", "_content": "Missing is the fact that the Japanese culture was such that all Japanese people, no matter where they were located, were expected to be true to the Emperor and do as directed and if they did not comply, the rulers would simply assassinate family members in Japan until they complied.

If the people could not be contacted through the \u2018messengers\u2019 already in the US, they could not be identified as refusing the Emperor.  Many of the people in the camps understood the problem very clearly.
