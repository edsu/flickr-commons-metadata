The haystacks were kept outside, and they were shaped to shed water.  If they were used during the first winter after they were made, rotting of the hay from moisture was minimal.  It wouldn't have been practical to keep all the hay inside because such a great quantity of hay was harvested each year to see the cattle through the long winter.  I think this was probably true in 1940 in Colorado also.  Also, keep in mind that the annual rainfall isn't that much in Colorado.
