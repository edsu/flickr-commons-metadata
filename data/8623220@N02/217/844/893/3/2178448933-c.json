The dimensions and near-center mount are consistent with the *barrel* of an M2A1 or M101 howitzer.  Note that the left end is turned down, which is characteristic of the breach end of the weapon.  She's using a micrometer to check a boss or flange of the outer diameter near the center mounting point, which is already greater than the roughly 4&quot; ID of the barrel.  No &quot;cutters&quot; are evident, so there's no way one could be inserted *into* the barrel.  The castellated sleeve is probably internally threaded and engages the external threads seen on the barrel directly behind her.", "authorname": "inspector23", "id": "8602872-2178448933-72157606415413768", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178448933/#comment72157622984082057", "realname": "R Kurtz", "path_alias": "kurtz433", "author": "55955453@N00", "iconserver": "7286", "datecreate": "1262282890", "_content": "inspector23,  Photographers are not engineers.", "authorname": "( kurtz )", "id": "8602872-2178448933-72157622984082057", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178448933/#comment72157634739038700", "realname": "Brant  Dempster", "path_alias": "thelimbreaper", "author": "44873393@N02", "iconserver": "7315", "datecreate": "1374438480", "_content": "I've found in military history research that many anomalies and aberrations occur between the photograph and the caption.  &quot;Kurtz&quot; said it best - &quot;Photographers are not engineers&quot;.", "authorname": "thelimbreaper", "id": "8602872-2178448933-72157634739038700", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2178448933"}}
