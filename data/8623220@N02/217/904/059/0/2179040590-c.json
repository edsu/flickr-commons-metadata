Light is suppose to go through a slide once, not through the slide to be reflected back through the slide THEN recorded.\r\n\r\nAlso, for a slide to be scanned it needs removed from the slide holder. I know these slides LOOK as though they have been removed from their card but that is something we can not be sure of unless we see cog holes. \r\n\r\nAlso a slide duplicator allows the photographing of film left in strips, or that have been mounted in cards, or unmounted single frames.\r\n\r\nI have downloaded numerous TIFFs and I am impressed at the clarity and sharpness.\r\n\r\nAlso, ALL these slides need doctored? ALL need more 'saturation'? That makes me want to laugh! Hate to tell you but not everything is colorful. Not all grass is Kelly Green. Or mayhaps your monitor needs calibrated.\r\n\r\nI've looked throught he first 89 pages of this archive and I have to say that overall I have been reminded of the fullness and richness of transparency films.", "authorname": "Filmann", "id": "8602872-2179040590-72157603790162501", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179040590/#comment72157603797429427", "realname": "Richard", "path_alias": "named", "author": "17708005@N00", "iconserver": "73", "datecreate": "1201318738", "_content": "Looks like a turkey buzzard on the roof.
