Connecticut Shade was harvested leaf by leaf (&quot;Primings&quot; - usually 3 leaves at a time as they matured; 5-6 &quot;primings&quot; a season) and the leaves dried.  The photo shows end of the harvest; the shade cloth sidewall has been taken down &amp; the plants knocked down to rot into the soil as a green fertilizer.  The shade top cloth will come off next and be recycled as sidewall the next season.  You can see that the pole rows haven't been cut down yet - the plants are still pushing the top cloth up - they had to be cut by hand w/ machetes.", "authorname": "abg@shade", "id": "8602872-2179045276-72157603867325482", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179045276/#comment72157627713381918", "realname": "Tim holliday", "path_alias": null, "author": "9302892@N02", "iconserver": "6159", "datecreate": "1316532460", "_content": "There is a 1961 film, Parrish, that I saw on AMC last month.
