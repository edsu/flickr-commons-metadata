The obesity epidemic began in the late 1980's, early 1990's, caused by many factors non-existent 40, 50, 60 years ago, like food addiction and food as therapy and ginormous, super-sized portions at restaurants, movie theaters, etc.\n\nI graduated high school in 1980, and there was only ONE fat student in my entire graduating class. In fact, I think that person was the only fat person in the entire student body.  Everybody was skinny, boys and girls, like these people in these photographs, and we had plenty of food back in the 1980's.\n\nCheck out the photographs from the 1970's in the U. S. National Archives photostream.  EVERYBODY was skinny, and I don't remember any kind of a food shortage in the 1970's either.\n\nLook at this group of slender, young women from the early 1970's:\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/7461393070/in/set-72157630329782642]\n\nAnd this group of young people:\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/7455138962/]\n\nSomething you'd never see today, but back then, this was normal.", "authorname": "scrnnmna", "id": "8602872-2178352395-72157634495833118", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "2178352395"}}
