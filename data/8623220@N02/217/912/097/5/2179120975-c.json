So far, no country except Ethiopia has recognized Somaliland, though there are rumors that recognition may be comming.\n\n Note also that Burma (Myanmar) is part of British India. This may be an old map, I think the British had seperated Burma by this time (though independence did not come until the late 1940's.) Burma had never historically been part of India and many Burmese were enraged when the British made it part of their Raj after overthrowing the monarchy in the 1880's.", "authorname": "Boonlong1",
