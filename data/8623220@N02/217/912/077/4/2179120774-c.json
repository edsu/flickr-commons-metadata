I lived among the apple, peach cherry and pear orchards (and worked in them--that was hard) until I got out of HS in 1962.  I never saw this many new fruit boxes in a row in all that time.  There was a sawmill in Delta, between 7 &amp; 15 miles away, but to my knowlege they made no boxes there.  Most of the oldtimers there have died and so has much of the history.
