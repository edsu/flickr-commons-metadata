He had worked for many years at Liggett\u2019s Drug Store across the street as a \u201cPatent Man\u201d but after getting married in 1929, he soon decided he wanted to own his own business as so many Greek immigrants did.   He was a success story in that he had sold newspapers as a young immigrant boy on the same corner \u2013School and Main Street many years before.  He and his business partners started out to open a candy store.   One of the stories I remember was that they bought a gas stove.  A lady came out to demonstrate the stove and suggested they could boil chicken and serve sliced chicken sandwiches, and chicken salad sandwiches.  This lady was Ruth Wakefield \u2013 later the owner of the well known Toll House Restaurant and the originator of the Toll House Cookie or the Chocolate Chip Cookie.  The sliced chicken sandwich was a specialty until the Sylvia Restaurant closed in the late 60\u2019s.   Mrs. Wakefield always remembered my father by name whenever we went to the Toll House for special dinners.\n\nThe whole family at one time or another worked at \u201cSylvia\u2019s\u201d--my mother Effie, my brother Nick, my sister Dorothea and myself, Elaine.  Sylvia\u2019s is often remembered in the Brockton newspaper \u2018The Enterprise\u201d column \u201cFrom our Readers\u201d as a downtown fixture \u2013 after the movies, catching a bus to and from the surrounding towns to shop in downtown Brockton,  and a high school hangout.  Sales people and office workers downtown were regulars for lunch and coffee breaks.   I remember well the two ladies who worked at McCarthy\u2019s in the fifties and would come in on Friday night, when the stores were open until 9pm and order Salmon Salad on plain dark bread and my father would enjoy making it extra special for them every week \u2013 cut in fours with toothpicks.  .  \n\nIn the early fifties downtown Brockton was changing and the business was changing.  My parents decided to remodel the Tea Room which had beautiful mahogany paneling and booths, a marble soda fountain, black glass table tops and oval top mirrors.   It became a modern fifties luncheonette and the name was changed to Sylvia Restaurant and that was when I worked there.  My sister and I started out working by \u201ctyping the menus.\u201d  Every day the specials changed and there was a typed menu that was added to the plastic covered Sylvia menu, which had an oval old-fashioned picture of \u201cSylvia.\u201d (I wish I had a copy of that menu.)  I was told Sylvia was a pretty girl who came over on the Mayflower.  The Greek immigrants wanted to assimilate into American life so they thought the Mayflower was all American.  My mother remembered that when they first opened the Tea Room, she spoke to my father in Greek and he told her to go to the back room to talk to him, as customers didn\u2019t like to hear a foreign language.  She was so upset, she vowed to learn English.  She attended night school and continued for many years, first for English and to become a citizen and then for other classes.  \n\nI vaguely remember when my father still made ice cream for the Tea Room.  Of course we only had Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry and Coffee and it was packed in those round Pint or Quart containers.  If  I happened to be there when he was making ice cream,  I would have soft strawberry before it was frozen and this was a special treat.  He told stories that during the depression, they were able to make a good living selling ice cream cones as families could afford a 5 cent ice cream cone.  Of course in those days one never visited someone\u2019s home without a box of chocolates and originally candy was the main focus of the business.\n\nEveryone had his or her special food at Sylvia\u2019s.  Mine was chopped ham and pickle and a strawberry milk shake.  I think I ate that every time I went there in my childhood days.  We would see a \u201cregular\u201d come in and have his coffee, tea or cold drink in front of him before he asked for it.  We had many bachelors that lived in the rooming houses near Main St. who would come in for their dropped eggs on toast for 35 cents in the fifties.  Many of them couldn\u2019t afford much more and occasionally they would have a real lunch or dinner.  We often refered to people by what they ordered, not by their name, since we often didn\u2019t know their name. \n\nI don\u2019t remember the early days but I heard about them over the years.  Some of the stories reflect the family and community atmosphere of a local downtown tea room.  After the war, my dad gave jobs to many of the service men coming back home \u2013 many  went on to become successful Brockton business and professional men, some  to college and some worked at Sylvia\u2019s on and off for years to come.  Romances were also a part of Sylvia\u2019s \u2013 waitresses and soda fountain men, customers and of course high school sweethearts.   There were three shifts \u2013 the morning crew, the day crew and the night crew worked until 11:00 so that the movie crowd could come in for a snack after the movie.  If you were a \u201csoda jerk\u201d you worked at the end of the counter, pouring Cokes from the red coke machine or making milk shakes, frappes or ice creams sundaes.   Only the more expert counter men worked the sandwich counter.  The waitresses all wore uniforms with those pretty handkerchiefs in their pockets.  \n\nI also remember the Christmas Holiday Season and the Easter season when everyone from Brockton and the surrounding towns came downtown to shop.  We didn\u2019t see much of my dad in those busy times when he often worked 16 hours a day.   He went to work in a suit and tie, with an overcoat and hat, changed his clothes in his \u201coffice\u201d always wearing a tie and a white long sleeve shirt with a white bib apron.    I also remember a lovely little lady who was the bookkeeper.  She would come once a week to do the payroll and pay the bills.  Downstairs was the office, the ice cream making machine and the kitchen with the dumb waiter to send up the food.     \n\nMy parents, along with countless people who have wonderful memories of Brockton would be so proud to know that downtown Brockton at the corner of School and Main Street and Sylvia Sweets Tea Room was used as an example of a \u201cstreet in an industrial town in Massachusetts.\u201d  \nElaine (Dayos) Liatsos  8/2008", "authorname": "sostaile", "id": "8602872-2178249475-72157606937998055", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178249475/#comment72157607031088189", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "26538946@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1220138994", "_content": "Thanks for this beautiful account of your family's restaurant.

More than 50 years ago and it's like yesterday!\nAnn Blunt Condon  thejoyofsuccess@comcast.net", "authorname": "the joy of success", "id": "8602872-2178249475-72157615621495638", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178249475/#comment72157619660463447", "realname": "Tomasz Olejnik", "path_alias": "uroborus", "author": "7437903@N06", "iconserver": "3705", "datecreate": "1245017386", "_content": "love it !", "authorname": "Tomasz Olejnik - Photography", "id": "8602872-2178249475-72157619660463447", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178249475/#comment72157622548739150", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "43289072@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1255097273", "_content": "I love this picture. \n\nYou should get in touch with the bizymoms <a href=\"http://www.bizymoms.com/brockton/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Brockton </a> community to feature these on their page.

Sylvia Sweets was a Brockton institution enjoyed by many generations of Brocktonians. I recall so many times what a special trip it was to take the bus downtown to go shopping at Besse Bakers or Edgars or Kreseges or to take in a movie at one of the theaters. Sylvia Sweets was always the place to stop before heading home. If you want to see more pictures of Brockton as it was back when we were in school, check out the Stanley Baumann photo collection at Stonehill College. It's on Facebook and you may even find yourself in one of the pictures. Stanley Baumann alway seemed to be everywhere with a camera. As this wonderful picture of Sylvia Sweets did, his old pictures also bring back great memories of what a great city we lived in for a time.

Looking at the rare color photo from the 1940's of Sylvia Sweet's Tea Room in Brockton, MA puts a longing in the soul.  It's like there is a yearning for the ability for those doors to be open again and be able to walk through and enjoy a fried clam dinner for only .40cents.  So at today's prices that would be more like $6-$10 but it would be nice. An interest in a time that seemed simpler.  The place looks like it was full of many delicious meals and from the posts I perused after the pictures were posted, this was confirmed.  Many people have enjoyed many good memories there and the color photo was amazing at drawing those memories out to the light of conversation after such a long time in remission.  I looked at the photo of the same corner today on Google map full of traffic passing through.  A couple of people standing on another corner taking an outdoor break.  The opposite corner has a computer repair shop.  Looking at that corner made me wish for Sylvia Sweets to be there again.  That corner in that town looks like it needs something like Sylvia Sweets there again bringing activity, good food, good company and a sense of community back to that corner again.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if Sylvia Sweets could be brought back from the tomes of history and the 1940's to the year 2013 or 2014?", "authorname": "greatgardeningg", "id": "8602872-2178249475-72157630683225848", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178249475/#comment72157631982573750", "realname": "Harold Seifert", "path_alias": null, "author": "89839197@N08", "iconserver": "7255", "datecreate": "1352651388", "_content": "love diners!", "authorname": "haroldseifert", "id": "8602872-2178249475-72157631982573750", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178249475/#comment72157635349468272", "realname": "Pablo Ardila", "path_alias": null, "author": "101245745@N08", "iconserver": "7300", "datecreate": "1378134614", "_content": "thanks for sharing this", "authorname": "ardila.pablo", "id": "8602872-2178249475-72157635349468272", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178249475/#comment72157638814259606", "realname": "belts lime", "path_alias": null, "author": "111903235@N05", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1387434070", "_content": "Excellent", "authorname": "beltslime", "id": "8602872-2178249475-72157638814259606", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178249475/#comment72157638870247926", "realname": "Steve Azhocar", "path_alias": null, "author": "112078551@N02", "iconserver": "5509", "datecreate": "1387604681", "_content": "Its superb :)", "authorname": "steveazhocar", "id": "8602872-2178249475-72157638870247926", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178249475/#comment72157638870286816", "realname": "Steve Azhocar", "path_alias": null, "author": "112078551@N02", "iconserver": "5509", "datecreate": "1387604796", "_content": "Its really good", "authorname": "steveazhocar", "id": "8602872-2178249475-72157638870286816", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2178249475"}}
