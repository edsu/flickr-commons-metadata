Almost every comment here that is trying to correct what someone else has said about the subject is WRONG. A few got some of the details right, but they didn't stop with what they had a reasonable knowledge about, they went on to guess at other things. The barrage balloons were filled with helium, not hydrogen. They were used to deter low-flying aircraft and were used in groups around important military and industrial targets. They were NOT used to defend ships at sea, a very popular misconception. The photos of ships with barrage balloons flying above them were merely transporting the balloons for use on an invasion beach or inland. By having the balloons already inflated, it saved considerable time in making them operational once they reached land. The balloons shown flying above ships are too low to be effective against ANY aircraft. And flying them higher, because of the motion of the ships, puts too much strain on the steel cables, which could cause them to snap, thus not only losing the balloon, but the snapped cable could injure or kill men on the ships. Most barrage balloons were transported uninflated along with the equipment needed to inflate, raise them and secure them. The balloons had to be periodically lowered, more helium added, and then raised again. They were not used to &quot;deflect bombs.&quot; (Seriously?!) They were not used to fake out pilots or cause disruption of line of sight (you're confusing the balloons with camouflage). Also, you can't have anti-aircraft weapons and barrage balloons in the same vicinity - the guns could inadvertently destroy the balloons. The two are dispersed in rings around a potential target so that each can do its job without being impeded by the other. And the balloons could not be &quot;placed at right angles&quot; on the landing beaches. The balloons could not be &quot;aimed&quot; in a certain direction. It wasn't the balloons themselves that planes were afraid of (which could be easily seen by the pilots and aircrews) - it was the cable beneath the balloon which could damage or destroy an aircraft when hit. The balloons were even used during the defense of London against the V1 flying bombs - at least one was brought down by a balloon. How do I know all this? Because I published a book, &quot;The U.S. Army Barrage Balloon Program&quot; by James Shock, the current 4th edition was released in 2006 (first published in 1997) and is still available from my company, Merriam Press, you can view sample pages at GoogleBooks. Shock received the 2010 Lifetime Achievement Award from The Lighter-Than-Air Society, having researched, studied and written about all types of LTA topics since high school and served in the US Army during WWII. Google the book's title and you'll see a number of web sites/pages that reference the book and/or the author. The book is a revised and expanded version of his article that appeared in the Spring 1989 issue of the AAHS (American Aviation Historical Society) Journal. The book is still available new from Merriam Press; currently it is not in distribution and so is not available from Amazon or other online booksellers at this time (I'm working on putting it into the distribution system, but that takes time and money); as I write this someone is offering a copy on Amazon for almost twice the retail price of the paperback.", "authorname": "raymerriam", "id": "8602872-2178246585-72157627476950209", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178246585/#comment72157629523464665", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "55380597@N02", "iconserver": "1239", "datecreate": "1331010630", "_content": "Cool<img src=\"http://s04.flagcounter.com/map/rzN/size=t/txt=FFFFFF/border=FFFFFF/pageviews=0/viewers=3/\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><img src=\"http://s04.flagcounter.com/count/rzN/bg=ffffff/txt=ffffff/border=ffffff/columns=1/maxflags=1/viewers=0/labels=0/.jpg\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><img src=\"http://2.s04.flagcounter.com/count/rzN/bg=ffffff/txt=ffffff/border=ffffff/columns=1/maxflags=1/viewers=0/labels=0/.jpg\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />", "authorname": "\u00c9othain", "id": "8602872-2178246585-72157629523464665", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178246585/#comment72157630620172608", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "60679260@N03", "iconserver": "7144", "datecreate": "1342536122", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/26467189@N05] \n\nBINGO!
