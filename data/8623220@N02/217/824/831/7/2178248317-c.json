And documenting the condition of American farmland.  \nNotice in these photos how the vegetation is very sparce.  That is because the topsoil has been eroded away after a hundred years of neglecting the soil.  Up until the late 1930's many farmers simply removed the trees from the forrests and planted crops on the naturally rich soil.  After a few years the natural nutrients were depleted and crops wouldn't grow so the farmer moved to &quot;new ground&quot; and left the old fields.   Since there wasn't enough nutrients in the soil to support plants, the soils eroded.\nDuring and after WWII fertilizers became more affordable and farmers started practicing better farming techniques.", "authorname": "cdw1302", "id": "8602872-2178248317-72157614323846625", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178248317/#comment72157624098220848", "realname": "Amy", "path_alias": "amyjeff", "author": "39992802@N02", "iconserver": "2436", "datecreate": "1274326800", "_content": "It looks to me like these photos might have been taken in the southern pinelands, which can have sandy soil and support the type of flora you see pictured.", "authorname": "Just_Amy", "id": "8602872-2178248317-72157624098220848", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "2178248317"}}
