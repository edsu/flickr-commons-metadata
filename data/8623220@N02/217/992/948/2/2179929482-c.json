In 1974 I personally counted the growth rings on the stump of a 54 ft. circumference giant redwood cut down in Mendocino County by Georgia-Pacific, a corporation which has since left the county after logging off all the available redwoods from its lands. There were over 1540 countable rings on the big stump I counted, plus more years of growth in the center where the wood had rotted away over the centuries. I had to use a magnifying glass to clearly see and count some of the rings. Only a tiny percentage of the original 2,000,000 acres of Coast Redwood forest remains uncut. Forest protection activists have been trying to put the brakes on corporate liquidation logging for more than 30 years. Most people assume the remaining virgin redwoods have been saved, and are amazed that some people still think it's okay to cut them down for fancy decks and wall paneling. Redwood is not used for structural lumber. It's too expensive for that, because it's so rare. There's only one place in the world where the Sequioia sempervirens grows naturally, and I'm priveleged to live there. This photo has got me started, and I'm going to find that 1974 slide documenting the 1540 year old redwood and post it in my Flickr stream soon.", "authorname": "NWilson", "id": "8602872-2179929482-72157603863338572", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179929482/#comment72157604040793461", "realname": "", "path_alias": "i_like_plants", "author": "14571133@N03", "iconserver": "3049", "datecreate": "1204587303", "_content": "One word.....\r\n\r\n                                  'Amazing'!", "authorname": "I likE plants!", "id": "8602872-2179929482-72157604040793461", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179929482/#comment72157604100097673", "realname": "", "path_alias": "belleville", "author": "57954070@N00", "iconserver": "30", "datecreate": "1205270647", "_content": "Pioneers lived inside this tree which was burned out by a lightning strike.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/belleville/50876643/\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/32/50876643_62b9ee625d_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"DSC08668\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere, my family stands at the base of a large one\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/belleville/82578119/\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/37/82578119_f20d675f1f_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"smDSC03778\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMost people will never get a chance to see these.
