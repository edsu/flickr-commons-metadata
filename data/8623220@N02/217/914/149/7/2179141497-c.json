We would unofficially refer to the wool alphas as winter, and the poly alphas as summer, although they were usually prescribed with consideration to environmental temperature  However, for inspection purposes, either style would be designated, at any time. Generally, the poly alphas got a lot more wear than the wool alphas.   Yes, alphas, as well as charlies,  were worn when first reporting in to a unit.   Alphas were also worn for ceremonies such as change of command and annual USMC birthday formations, as well as for formal events such as organized banquets.  I was addressing NiMaGaNiN's question rather than discussing any specific uniform.  Also noteworthy, the seasonal change over involving the utilility blouse specified having the sleeves rolled up for the warmer months.  Some commanders were sticklers for uniformity, which affected the wear of other items such as gloves, scarves, watch caps and field jackets.\nSemper Fi", "authorname": "ddrfires308", "id": "8602872-2179141497-72157610467552383", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179141497/#comment72157623257368901", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "47333052@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1265663461", "_content": "Does anyone out there know exactly what kind of shoes were worn with this uniform?
