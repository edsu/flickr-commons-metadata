Yes the dugout interior walls are covered with cardboard - The dugout itself is made of large logs - Not sure what the roof is. I don't know if Jack dug the space-cut the tree's-hauled the rocks for the 'foundation'-not sure what the roof is made of - or see any bathroom (i'm sure was outdoors. Look at the tenacity/hardness of his face. The mother has a hard worn edge - 5 children-keeping the homestead up not to mention I'll bet she was out in the fields with the children doing their part to help. I also got a sense of community from these photo's. They may not have had &quot;the best&quot; but the children look relatively healthy. They went to school-church-worked-played. It feels like a family unit that worked/played together during extremely tough times. They worked hard and brought the family together to enjoy the fruits of their labors. Wonder if any of the children still survive? Did they stay in the area? Did they grow up and get as far away as they could? Was there more going on in that dugout than what we think we see thru the lens of the camera?Would be fascinating to hear their life story.", "authorname": "gregorterri2", "id": "8602872-2179146618-72157603794621032", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179146618/#comment72157603881064568", "realname": "e lyford", "path_alias": "ejly", "author": "72656763@N00", "iconserver": "81", "datecreate": "1202655737", "_content": "I saw this first at Shorpy. <a>&quot;The House that Jack built&quot;</a> and at that site there is much more information about the family.
