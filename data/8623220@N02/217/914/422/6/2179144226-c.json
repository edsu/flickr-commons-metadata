The photo is in New Mexico, ( I live in New Mexico), and those are cowboys. But, vaqueros pre-date the cowboy. Vaqueros date to early 1600's. Cowboys were an product of the Americans 1850 arrival in the Southwest and adopting, then changing, the vaquero culture that existed.  The vaquero culture used specific equipment, lassos of 120 feet intead of the cowboys 60 foot lassos. The vaquero were on open ranges while cowboys fenced the ranches. I can assure you the photo was on a fenced ranch. And those are not vaqueros.
