The medal is given by the Dept. of Defense and is USUALLY presented by the President, but hasn't always been.\n\nThe medal was created on July 12,1862 when President Abraham Lincoln signed S.J.R. No. 82.\nIt read:\nResolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that the President of the United States be, and he is hereby, authorized to cause two thousand &quot;medals of honor&quot; to be prepared with suitable emblematic devices, and to direct that the same be presented, in the name of the Congress, to such non-commissioned officers and privates as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry in action, and other soldier-like qualities, during the present insurrection (Civil War).\n\nOn March 3,1863 offficers were also allowed to win the MoH.\n\nOn August 5,1958 the Congressional Medal of Honor Society was chartered by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nFor more info check out their website at <a href=\"http://www.cmohs.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.cmohs.org</a>", "authorname": "D.
