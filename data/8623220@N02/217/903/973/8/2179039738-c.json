See all the utility poles?  Of course not, there was no electricity, no telephone, no connection with the outside world.  I lived there (Southern Appalachia) from the mid sixties until 1980.  Even then, there were pockets -- communities that were as isolated as they had been since the Cherokee Removal (Trail of Tears).  That is to say, they had no passable roads, mules were as common as jalopies (or moonshiner's hot rods) where electricity was available it was so new that the people only thought to hang a bare light bulb from the ceiling,  No telephones, and while broadcast television was possible, it took a mighty antenna to get a snowy image from Atlanta or Greenville SC. (and nobody could afford either the TV set or the antenna anyway)  For my personal experience of &quot;impoverishment,&quot; I lived without electricity, telephone, etc from 1975 to 1980, not so much because it wasn't available, but because I could not afford it.  My family (wife and two kids) and I recall that period as a time of great richness.  We would lie in reclining lawn chairs, sometimes bundled in sleeping bags and observe the stars, or we would hike in the woods, sometimes for extended trips of three to five days, learning about trees, flowers, butterflies, etc.  Today we all live in the 21st century with a TV set the size of a barn door, a car that goes 90, THE INTERNET, air conditioning, etc.  Am I richer than I was then?
