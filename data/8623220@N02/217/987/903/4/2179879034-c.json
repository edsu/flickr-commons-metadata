Further, the term Zeppelin, as used generically for airships, refers only to <b>rigid</b> airships or dirigibles.  i recommend the removal of the &quot;Zeppelin&quot; tag for historical accuracy.", "authorname": "Nathan J Shaulis", "id": "8602872-2179879034-72157605004807291", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2179879034"}}
