Two black mixer motors are able to slide up and down to imerse the wire mesh into the sample. The sample beakers are heated from below. \n\nIons allow current to flow in the liquid. Pure water, clean and deionized, is an electrical insulator. The amount of current that flows through the liquid at known temperatures can be measured and help deterimine the concentration of the material in suspension.", "authorname": "Dr. Disney Wizard", "id": "8602872-2179184290-72157610826874725", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2179184290"}}
