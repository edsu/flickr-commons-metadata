The load was then carried to a threshing area to remove the grain from the stock. The stock or &quot;straw&quot; was not thrown away, but was used for bedding livestock. It has little feed value.\r\n\r\nThe harvesting today is, of course, mechanized. The cutting and threshing is done in one operation, right in the field. The straw is discarded from the combine onto the ground, and baled later. \r\n\r\nThe large bales that you see sitting in the fields are most likely &quot;hay&quot;, or grasses, alfalpha, and clovers that are grown for feed.", "authorname": "ljp_roatan_island", "id": "8602872-2179082031-72157603803436535", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179082031/#comment72157614455512559", "realname": "", "path_alias": "nzsofika", "author": "54078984@N00", "iconserver": "3797", "datecreate": "1235808638", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/931454@N23/\">HAYSTACKS</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Zsofia Nagy", "id": "8602872-2179082031-72157614455512559", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179082031/#comment72157630801644276", "realname": "Carlos Iborra", "path_alias": "panoramyx", "author": "7324442@N03", "iconserver": "8543", "datecreate": "1343560882", "_content": "I saw this image in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat</a> !", "authorname": "Panoramyx", "id": "8602872-2179082031-72157630801644276", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "2179082031"}}
