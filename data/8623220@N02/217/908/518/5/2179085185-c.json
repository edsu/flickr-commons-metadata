This highly implausible tale reflects the extent to which people will make their own lives as significant as possible in times of stress and anxiety. There was no information that might have come out of the Monadnock Region that could have been of the slightest interest to our enemies, and it's extremely doubtful that light signals from Temple (elevation 2085 ft.) would be visible on the coast (roughly 65 mi. away), even on the region's rare clear nights.", "authorname": "Graycard", "id": "8602872-2179085185-72157603836621106", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179085185/#comment72157619876815029", "realname": "Josh Graciano", "path_alias": "newmundane", "author": "48094458@N00", "iconserver": "3685", "datecreate": "1245429363", "_content": "The story was about lights from a Monadnock area mountain which could be seen at sea during WWI.
