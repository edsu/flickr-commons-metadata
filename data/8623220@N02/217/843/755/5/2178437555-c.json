The &quot;louvers&quot; at the front of the aircraft are actually a Venetian blind that covers a transparent observer's window. The blinds helped to protect the window from seawater damage, and were opened in flight. The &quot;landing gear&quot; on this aircraft are actually &quot;beaching gear,&quot; which were attached to the aircraft after landing on the water so that it could taxi up a ramp onto the shore. Later models of the PBY had retractable landing gear and could land or takeoff on runways as well as on the water.", "authorname": "twomets", "id": "8602872-2178437555-72157603793327616", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178437555/#comment72157609041739752", "realname": "", "path_alias": "goph51", "author": "14557348@N00", "iconserver": "46", "datecreate": "1226650150", "_content": "Catalina...wow...it was a stunning airplane", "authorname": "bushpig [goph51]", "id": "8602872-2178437555-72157609041739752", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178437555/#comment72157612575068612", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pby5a", "author": "16612979@N00", "iconserver": "115", "datecreate": "1231971308", "_content": "Its a PBY-3 note the plane's behind it has the Round Rudder on them", "authorname": "Mitchel25J (3 million + Views Thank You )", "id": "8602872-2178437555-72157612575068612", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178437555/#comment72157612575079850", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pby5a", "author": "16612979@N00", "iconserver": "115", "datecreate": "1231971322", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/66296853@N00/\">Consolidated Aircraft</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Mitchel25J (3 million + Views Thank You )", "id": "8602872-2178437555-72157612575079850", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178437555/#comment72157618406804034", "realname": "", "path_alias": "peid", "author": "74443780@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1242641267", "_content": "<b>Awesome ! <a href=\"http://www.ts0.com/flickrcommenttools/\"><img src=\"http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/emoticons7/41.gif\" /></a></b>\n\n\nNice shot  <a href=\"http://www.ts0.com/flickrcommenttools/\"><img src=\"http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/emoticons7/1.gif\" /></a>", "authorname": "Diep159", "id": "8602872-2178437555-72157618406804034", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178437555/#comment72157621946887472", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "31435579@N08", "iconserver": "3071", "datecreate": "1249421052", "_content": "<img width=\"367\" height=\"263\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2553/3787763379_77cdd5db33_o_d.jpg\" />\n\n\n\n<i>Jean Dieuzaide &ndash; Concorde Essai de Freinge - 1968</i>\n\nHi,\nI'am the admin of the new group <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1218875@N22/\">Art'flighing Machines</a> dedicated to an artistic approach of flighing things\n\nIt would be an honour to have your picture into this group\n\n", "authorname": "reyfocus", "id": "8602872-2178437555-72157621946887472", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178437555/#comment72157621958390505", "realname": "Scott Kraft", "path_alias": "sakraft1", "author": "61941044@N00", "iconserver": "6", "datecreate": "1250680751", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1210109@N23/\">Tales Of The South Pacific</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "sakraft1", "id": "8602872-2178437555-72157621958390505", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178437555/#comment72157625503692656", "realname": "sergio verrecchia", "path_alias": "sergio_verrecchia_digital_imaging_technician", "author": "23653738@N03", "iconserver": "3780", "datecreate": "1291166494", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/thedigitographer\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4112/5062109741_7d40b53dec_m.jpg\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/thedigitographer/discuss/72157625503554760/\"> <img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4104/5185514368_f2eff145a9_m.jpg\" /></a>\nYour work is perfect for our\n<b>Contest #4: The World of Iron Wings!</b>\nPlease consider posting!", "authorname": "Sergio Verrecchia - Digital Imaging Technician", "id": "8602872-2178437555-72157625503692656", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178437555/#comment72157626755696036", "realname": "Perry Clifton", "path_alias": null, "author": "63052757@N05", "iconserver": "2471", "datecreate": "1305797920", "_content": "superb PBY shot.", "authorname": "pez6660", "id": "8602872-2178437555-72157626755696036", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178437555/#comment72157633950174287", "realname": "Logan Zillmer", "path_alias": "loganzillmer", "author": "23214132@N03", "iconserver": "5332", "datecreate": "1370455607", "_content": "Suuuuuuper dangerous.", "authorname": "loganzillmer", "id": "8602872-2178437555-72157633950174287", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2178437555"}}
