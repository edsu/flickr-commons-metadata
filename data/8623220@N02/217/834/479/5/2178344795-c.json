We've lived in NM for more than eight years and my parents were visiting it many years before I was born, and we've never been there before! Can you believe it?\n\nThank you for uploading these images, as they have been so fun to look at and provided me much inspiration! Imagine, losing your income (and everything else) in the Dust Bowl, and packing up your family to head over to The-Middle-Of-Nowhere, New Mexico, to try to start all over.  Look at us now!  We could all learn a lesson from these hard working folks!\n\n~A.M.\n\n(PS- I will be sure to take lots of pictures while I'm there!)", "authorname": "Graceful Wings (formerly *Miss~Mikaela*)", "id": "8602872-2178344795-72157617152261682", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178344795/#comment72157617218281148", "realname": "Jeff", "path_alias": "jeff_loc", "author": "34997905@N03", "iconserver": "3319", "datecreate": "1240493013", "_content": "Thanks for the note, Miss~Mikaela.
