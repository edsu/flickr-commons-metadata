I was a toddler when these pictures were made.  The FSA which paid the photographers to document America at that time was a &quot;New Deal&quot; program of FDR.  I remember when he died.  I also remember when JFK was assassinated  The mood of the country was the same both times.  I think the closest event in recent times is the death of Princess Diana.  I mention that so the younger generation will have an inkling of what I am trying to express.  These pictures portray our country at a time when the economy was so far worse than it is now that there is really no comparison.  The reason why our current economic plight is not as terrible as the Great Depression is entirely due to radical changes initiated by FDR.  When the Great Depression struck the country toward the end of the Hoover administration, there was no agency in the federal government available for assistance of any kind.  It was a purely capitalilstic economy, and except for a few weak and outdated laws passed to restrict monopolies, there was no government regulation of anything.  Likewise, there was no government encouragement of anything, either.  There was very little government at all, which sounds like the current idealism of what is called The Tea Party.  It is also the idealism of large corporations.  \n\nThe very existence of these pictures is a direct result of the New Deal programs of FDR.  Besides this beautiful collection, there are thousands of black-and-white prints  made all over the country, many of them now famous icons.  America needs to look back to see what kind of country we had before FDR before we decide to go back to those &quot;good old days.&quot;  These pictures are a good way to do that looking.", "authorname": "GroverH", "id": "8602872-2178343193-72157631432763922", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178343193/#comment72157631755352049", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "50432768@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1350084900", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/hauntedpalace] I agree", "authorname": "les1958", "id": "8602872-2178343193-72157631755352049", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178343193/#comment72157631755274312", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "50432768@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1350084958", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/16909288@N00] Amen!", "authorname": "les1958", "id": "8602872-2178343193-72157631755274312", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2178343193/#comment72157632218840249", "realname": "Albion Harrison-Naish", "path_alias": "albionharrisonnaish", "author": "42491491@N05", "iconserver": "8542", "datecreate": "1355228983", "_content": "What an absolutely, magically, timeless image.
