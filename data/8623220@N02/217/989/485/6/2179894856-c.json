It's still as beautiful as this when looking west.  The town has grown, not too much, a large Molly mine was built and destroyed the Red River that ran through town and down to the Rio Grande, the mine tailings were sent directly into the river.  The river has since recovered, still has a greenish blue tint, but fish are back.  Those domes are extinct volcanoes, this was once all grassland and was overgrazed by sheep which will eat grass to the root and sage and choya (cactus) moved in and have changed the landscape forever.  Not many people know this, but sheep destroyed much of the southwest due to overgrazing.", "authorname": "bill dwyer", "id": "8602872-2179894856-72157615400782707", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179894856/#comment72157624675851636", "realname": "", "path_alias": "craigluna", "author": "74992579@N00", "iconserver": "108", "datecreate": "1281231283", "_content": "Beyond beautiful... amazing.", "authorname": "Craig Luna", "id": "8602872-2179894856-72157624675851636", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "2179894856"}}
