If this is Greene County, Georgia, the poles and wires belong to the members of Rayle EMC (Electric Membership Cooperative).  The Frankliln D. Roosevelt Administration initiated a lot of new government agencies to rescue the country from the Great Depression.  Among those programs was the Rural Electrification Administration which was empowered to provide or guarantee low intererst loans to Electric Membership Cooperatives.
