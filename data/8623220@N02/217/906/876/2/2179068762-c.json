It was often suggested, during the fierce debates in the late 1990's and 2000 about removing the Confederate battle emblem from the Georgia State flag, that to remove the battle emblem was to reject history.  This photo is a good reminder of the reality of the situation.  (The Confederate battle emblem was added to the Georgia State flag only in 1956; if anything, the current flag, adopted in 2003, is actually closer to the historical flag, based on the Stars and Bars, as seen in this photo, than was the battle emblem flag adopted in 1956.)", "authorname": "Airships", "id": "8602872-2179068762-72157606890892025", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "2179068762"}}
