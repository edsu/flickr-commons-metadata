First of all the color films available at that time just didn't record colors like these.  The color films of that period simply weren't fast enough to capture exposures like these without the heavy direct flash look that we try to avoid.  In addition, the colors would have faded, or at least shifted in 66 year old photographs.\n\nThese photos certainly don't have the famous &quot;Kodachrome&quot; look of photos taken in this period.", "authorname": "stpenn", "id": "8602872-2179065003-72157611272570318", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2179065003"}}
