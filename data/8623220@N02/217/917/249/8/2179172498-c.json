It is a piece of history.  I understand that the currents of history colour the subtext of the word &quot;negro&quot; in a negative way, but the contemporary subtext of the word had no negative connotation.  \n\nSome folks want to toe the line between preserving history and placating today's overly-sensitive masses by suggesting that &quot;back then, they didn't know any better&quot;.  But it is not the photographer or his contemporaries that didn't know better: it's WE who don't know any better--the degree to which we've coddled and insulated ourselves against any objection anyone might raise anywhere about anything that is deemed offensive for whatever reason. \n\nLet us remember that in arguably the most stirring example of rhetoric for the equality of races in America, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., used the word &quot;negro&quot; fifteen times to describe his own people.  Are we to assume that Dr. King was ignorant or didn't know any better?  That he was one given to submitting to the whims of the time, even if he knew it was degrading?  The term was NOT degrading, but simply descriptive. Its degrading connotation is an after taste of decades of iniquity and struggle.  \n\nI expect my viewpoint to be lent little credence, uninformed as it is by the necessity of personal experience, but: if I were descended from this spirited, egregiously wronged, but ultimately triumphant lineage, I'd think I'd want to embrace such a term as &quot;negro&quot;, if only to invoke the power of continuity, history, solidarity, and oneness: uniting each new victory in an ongoing struggle to the trials from which it was born.\n\nI understand the desire to close ugly chapters of our past, and adopting new lexicon is one means of doing that.  But I think zealously whitewashing those things which are reminders of past iniquities, when the reminders themselves are innocuous, is in its own way one more form of binding and fragmenting a truly beautiful people whose whole story is incomparably rich and deserving of our entire attention and respect, not this piecemeal selective memory that passes for sensitivity.\n\n--\n<i>Seen on my Flickr home page.</i> <em>(<a href=\"http://6v8.gamboni.org/Flickr-Add-referer-into-comments.html\">?</a>)</em>", "authorname": "vertigelt", "id": "8602872-2179172498-72157611412785964", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179172498/#comment72157611542092044", "realname": "", "path_alias": "cprimm_manly427", "author": "12104215@N03", "iconserver": "2385", "datecreate": "1230001574", "_content": "wow i never thought there would be this much hoopla over a title. i like the word &quot;negro&quot; to be honest/ it not necessarily meaning &quot;black &quot; in english terms, but all shades of brown. i hate the terms &quot;african american&quot; and &quot;black&quot;  because i am neither one of those things.", "authorname": "Chauncy.Primm", "id": "8602872-2179172498-72157611542092044", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179172498/#comment72157611502158741", "realname": "John Phillips", "path_alias": "jonron239", "author": "25341432@N08", "iconserver": "2352", "datecreate": "1230078731", "_content": "I keep coming back to this - firstly because its a great shot and secondly to reread Joe Wigfall's comment.....", "authorname": "jonron239", "id": "8602872-2179172498-72157611502158741", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179172498/#comment72157611503524189", "realname": "Hoggarazzi Photography", "path_alias": "hoggarazzi", "author": "22714653@N08", "iconserver": "2334", "datecreate": "1230081876", "_content": "it cracks me up at how some people react to reality..I guess some people don't know their history..had the title been changed, this would just be another childs portrait. some need to see things for what they are..fantastic post by the way..cheers", "authorname": "Hoggheff aka Hank Ashby aka Mr. Freshtags", "id": "8602872-2179172498-72157611503524189", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179172498/#comment72157611612929470", "realname": "David Le Dru", "path_alias": "davidledru", "author": "21454264@N07", "iconserver": "2304", "datecreate": "1230170210", "_content": "My girlfriend says I'm (so) white.

In my life I have at various times in polite American society been referred to as colored, a Negro, Black, Afro-American, African American - and as well by members of my own &quot;race&quot; as well as others, by that almost universally impolite other <b>&quot;N&quot;</b> word.\nAt the time this photo was taken, &quot;Negro&quot; was considered to be a reference symbolizing the height of general public good manners.  Despite the current de rigueur term for non-Hispanic Americans of darker-hued skin tones, I much prefer to refer to myself as Black: as it is the only sure hint to my ancestry.  Whether my line originated on the African continent - or somewhere between there and Illinois, U.S.A. - or somewhere else, is lost in the murky pages of history; real and fancied.  What is important to me is how I live my own life, how I treat others, and how I allow myself to be treated.  So much out-of-context sniping and fretting about an antiquated term distracts from the artistic merit of this fine portrait and the glimpse into our history it shares with those who would see...\n<i>Anyway:</i>\nHi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/19351721@N00/\">Art is Art</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!\n\n<b>Art.

On January 26, 2008 my father was killed in a tragic car accident that took place only 2 minutes away from my home. My parents had been married for 30 years at the time of the accident without separation. As I have been assisting my mother with putting together various lawsuits and claims against several different persons, insurance companies, and even the Los Angeles Police Department regarding several acts of negligence and dishonor surrounding my fathers death, I have come across a disturbing piece of information that I, being a 24 year old African American person am appauled. My father having been born on April 9, 1955, has a birth certificate that identifies his color and race as being &quot;NEGRO.&quot; My grandmother, Eloise Marie Harrison having been born on April 4, 1933 has a birth certificate that identifies her color and race as being &quot;NEGRO&quot;. My mother, who is still alive, Clancyna Marie Atkins born on September 4, 1956 has a birth certificate that identifies her color and race as being &quot;NEGRO&quot; as well.  And I am quite sure there are thousands if not milliions of other African American people dead or alive who have been identified on paper at birth as being &quot;NEGRO&quot; I am absolutely disgusted that the United States of America even in 2009 have not made an attempt to make right this defamation of character in administering all new birth certificates to those who have died as well as those still living to identify these HUMAN PEOPLE with dignity and respect. I am passionately committed to make my fathers name wholly reflect the honorable father, husband, and man that he was and the fact that his life was not even given an opportunity to start before he was branded on United States of America paper as being a &quot;NEGRO&quot; is a disgrace and a shame on America.\n \nPLEASE SUPPORT THIS MESSAGE TO THE WHITE HOUSE BY SIGNING MY ONLINE PETITION at: <a href=\"http://www.gopetition.com/online/29117.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.gopetition.com/online/29117.html</a>\n \nIf you have any questions e- mail me at: kingdom.servant.dani@gmail.com\n \nThank You,\nDani", "authorname": "kingdomservantdani", "id": "8602872-2179172498-72157621812787847", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179172498/#comment72157621813604735", "realname": "Rich", "path_alias": "spacecamp", "author": "51318068@N00", "iconserver": "7366", "datecreate": "1249346643", "_content": "lol", "authorname": "flee the cities", "id": "8602872-2179172498-72157621813604735", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179172498/#comment72157621957337696", "realname": "Rich", "path_alias": "spacecamp", "author": "51318068@N00", "iconserver": "7366", "datecreate": "1249514222", "_content": "Who\n\nfreaking\n\ncares", "authorname": "flee the cities", "id": "8602872-2179172498-72157621957337696", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179172498/#comment72157621960080224", "realname": "Ashlee", "path_alias": "rose-colored-lens", "author": "23389288@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1249541181", "_content": "Beautiful boy.", "authorname": "a was here", "id": "8602872-2179172498-72157621960080224", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179172498/#comment72157621962310300", "realname": "", "path_alias": "widehaus", "author": "36225486@N00", "iconserver": "2561", "datecreate": "1249567704", "_content": "Don't be ridiculous my friends..the title is correct and the photo is fantastic....&quot;You have no reason to be ashamed of your \nancestors.
