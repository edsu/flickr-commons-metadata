Long\nSubmitted by Charles David Long on Fri, 11/27/2009 - 11:57pm.\n\nC.A. Long was my great-grandfather. The building in the photo was constructed in 1896 for the International Order of Odd Fellows. The Lodge used the top story for its meetings and rented the ground floor. Charles Anderson Long (1859-1939) moved his grocery business from Williamsburg, Ohio, to Mount Orab in 1931.\n\nThe business before C.A. rented it in 1931 was a shop that assembled horse buggies (see second photo below). Charles rented the building for his grocery business. His son Julius Paul Long had taken over the grocery in 1939 after C.A.'s death. My father, J.P. Long Jr., bought the grocery in 1968 and continued the business on the corner of 74 &amp; 68 until 1972, when it moved north of town on State Route 68. It closed in 1988.\n\nThe Marvel was the movie theater in town about one block south on Route 68. It is now being used as the local Masonic Lodge. Route 74 was renamed State Route 32 and then eventually Tri-County Road. The IOOF building was sold when the Lodge closed (1990s?) and is now being used as a women's clothing store.", "authorname": "Chappycdl", "id": "8602872-2179171338-72157625575387357", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179171338/#comment72157628554328559", "realname": "Bill Koontz", "path_alias": "koontzb", "author": "50016613@N06", "iconserver": "4029", "datecreate": "1324764228", "_content": "The building is still standing on the north-west corner of &quot;Main and High&quot; in Mt.
