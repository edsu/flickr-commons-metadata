They had meets there during inclement weather.   I remember going there with my father.  As I recall, they did everything but pole vault due to the low ceiling.  Its been about 10 years since I've been in the &quot;mushroom gardens&quot; as it was called.    Before Ed Weir, they ran outdoor meets inside the stadium proper.   You'd run straight along the east and west side of the football field, then run around the sweeping curves at the north and south ends.   There used to be storage areas on the the north and south ends of the east and west stadiums.  These areas stored the hurdles and gear the meets needed.  I remember seeing javelins, shots, discus, being stored in the equipment room in the north stadium building that had the clock on it.  That building is gone now.", "authorname": "West A Dad", "id": "8602872-2179171654-72157603988982626", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179171654/#comment72157606978408380", "realname": "Jeramy Phillips", "path_alias": "honkerdown", "author": "96921305@N00", "iconserver": "124", "datecreate": "1219854349", "_content": "Here is a little additional information on the &quot;mushroom gardens&quot;, and the rec center that replaced them.\n\n<a href=\"http://media.www.dailynebraskan.com/media/storage/paper857/news/1999/10/05/UndefinedSection/Students.Took.Initiative.For.Rec.Center-1736684.shtml\">media.www.dailynebraskan.com/media/storage/paper857/news/...</a>", "authorname": "honkerdown", "id": "8602872-2179171654-72157606978408380", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179171654/#comment72157610632763873", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "19967078@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1228349347", "_content": "reminds me of the summer olympics. looks like he could be an olympian", "authorname": "xia828", "id": "8602872-2179171654-72157610632763873", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179171654/#comment72157616572967700", "realname": "ra kodok", "path_alias": null, "author": "36081008@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1239344383", "_content": "stop actions isn't?", "authorname": "dadidudo227", "id": "8602872-2179171654-72157616572967700", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179171654/#comment72157617315886082", "realname": "", "path_alias": "aurimacavalcante", "author": "13578105@N07", "iconserver": "3159", "datecreate": "1240697776", "_content": "lindissimo seu trabalho,muito lindo", "authorname": "kall_cavalcante", "id": "8602872-2179171654-72157617315886082", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179171654/#comment72157617871735048", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "36625297@N07", "iconserver": "3637", "datecreate": "1241801728", "_content": "assurda, e bellissima!", "authorname": "Kira Yosumaky", "id": "8602872-2179171654-72157617871735048", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2179171654"}}
