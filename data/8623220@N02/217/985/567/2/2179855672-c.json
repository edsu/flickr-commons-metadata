The 13th test bed model was redesignated Y1B-17A and provided with GR-1820-51 engines with General Electric turbocharger (supercharger powered by a turbine driven by exhaust gas). It flew for the first time on 29 April 1938 and subsequent testing gave proof of the superiority of the supercharged engine over normally aspirated ones and such engines were to become standard.\r\nThe YB-17's were designated B-17 by the 2nd Bombardment group at this point.\r\nThere was great political tension between the Army and the Navy at this point after the interception of the Italian liner &quot;Rex&quot;  which goes a long way to explaining why the USAAC had only 30 on the books when war broke out in Europe. \r\nThe order for Y1B-17 was followed by a contract for 39 B-17B's (same as the turbocharged Y1B-17A) which were all delivered by March 1940.\r\nThe B-17C, with uprated R-1820-65 engines and an increase from 5 to 7 guns were first ordered in 1939, and the first of 38 models flew in July 1940.", "authorname": "Szmytke", "id": "8602872-2179855672-72157603778862727", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179855672/#comment72157603781535101", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pby5a", "author": "16612979@N00", "iconserver": "115", "datecreate": "1201061700", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/317277@N25/\">B-17 Flying Fortress</a>, and we'd love to have your photo added to the group.", "authorname": "Mitchel25J (3 million + Views Thank You )", "id": "8602872-2179855672-72157603781535101", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "2179855672"}}
