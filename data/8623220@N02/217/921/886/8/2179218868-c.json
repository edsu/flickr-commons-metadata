Are also very similar in stature to the existing and operating #3 blast furnace at USS Edgar Thomson works 20 minutes away from this site over in Braddock. This would mean these were photographed freshly after a rebuild which made them some of the most modern at the time of the shoot (renovated c.1936). ET #3 retains most of its original structure and was fully renovated and and computerized/automated from 1980-87. The command center for #3 occupies the site where #4's stoves stood having been gone for more than 40 years now.\n\nAnyone have an idea of when these Etna furnaces were torn down?", "authorname": "IronMan0737", "id": "8602872-2179218868-72157622457280097", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2179218868"}}
