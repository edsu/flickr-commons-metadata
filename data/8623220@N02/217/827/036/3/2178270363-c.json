I was looking at the cotton sacks, our were made different, we had a four inch strap to protect our shoulder, a wire going half way around the mouth of sack, this way it alway stay open, making much easier to throw the cotton, back inside the sack without looking back. I just made my first cotton, made out of duck Canvas, it nine feet long.  Thanks again for all the beauiful pictures, Martin Chapa, El Milero", "authorname": "martiniano757@yahoo.com", "id": "8602872-2178270363-72157624879962507", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2178270363"}}
