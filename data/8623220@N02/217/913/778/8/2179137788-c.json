You've spotted one of the anomalies that happens when historical images are loaded to Flickr in batches. \n\nThe date &quot;1940 Oct.&amp;quot (in the description on the left) refers to when the photographer probably snapped the shutter. It's the date that came with the original photo caption.\n\nThe year that displays when searching for photos and under &quot;additional information&quot; (on the right) reflects the single year we were limited to while loading an entire set of photos as a batch.  We picked &quot;1940&quot; to indicate the closest decade. The month &quot;Jan.&quot; also comes from the batch loading settings.\n\nWe'll keep looking for a way to synch up the real date and the batch-loading date.", "authorname": "The Library of Congress", "id": "8602872-2179137788-72157605966263873", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179137788/#comment72157612204149459", "realname": "", "path_alias": "cryptia", "author": "90081436@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1231276617", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/376845@N21/\">The frugal kitchen (photo's &amp; recipes)</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Cryptia.", "id": "8602872-2179137788-72157612204149459", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179137788/#comment72157622571760677", "realname": "Koda Bear", "path_alias": "koda24", "author": "83045392@N00", "iconserver": "85", "datecreate": "1256923911", "_content": "Thank you for clarifying the photos ;)", "authorname": "koda24", "id": "8602872-2179137788-72157622571760677", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "2179137788"}}
