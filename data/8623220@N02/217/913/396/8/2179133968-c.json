It says she was born in Adrin, TX, Lawrence and Wanda passed away before Velva, and as far as I know Laura and A.J are still alive. At the time of Velva's passing, Laura lived in Clifton, CO with the married name Murray, and Jack lived in Clifton. It doesn't say which of the many Cliftons it is, so I am guessing it is Clifton, TX.

One source says that Edith was born on May 5, 1909, making her 30 years old in this picture, though I can't verify it. Man, it took me long enough to find that information!
