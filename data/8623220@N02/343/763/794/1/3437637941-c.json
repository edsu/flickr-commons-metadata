Harvey D. Higley was my great uncle, brother of my paternal grandfather and son of Elmer A. Higley from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  From what I recall from family conversation, he rose to Brigadier General and was offered a post as commander of West Point, but declined for health reasons.  Died in 1963 in Carmel, CA, buried at Arlington.
