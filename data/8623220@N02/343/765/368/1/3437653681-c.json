There was no such match in 1910, but there were matches in 1909 and 1911 (among other years). Comparing this photo to photos in the book shows similar uniforms (dark shirt, pith-type helmet with dark band around it) for the British teams; for example there's a photo of the 1914 British team on page 189.
