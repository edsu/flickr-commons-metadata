Courtney (November 13, 1849 \u2013 July 17, 1920) was an American rower and rowing coach from Union Springs, New York. A carpenter by trade, Courtney was a nationally known amateur rower. Courtney never lost as an amateur and finished a total of 88 victories.\n\nIn 1877 he moved from an amateur to a professional rower, a decision that Courtney would later regret. His professional career was marred by controversy and accusations including cowardice and race fixing. His professional career was best remembered for his controversial losses to Ned Hanlan. Some[who?] believe that the controversies surrounding the Hanlan and Courtney races caused a public backlash against professional rowing that eventually led to its death in the United States.\n\nAs his rowing career wound down, Courtney became involved in coaching at Cornell University. He coached Cornell\u2019s rowing team from 1883 to 1920. His crews won 14 of 24 Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship Regatta, varsity eight oared titles. He kept his position until he died in the summer of 1920.\n\nSource: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_E._Courtney\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_E._Courtney</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-3438452112-72157621818087994", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3438452112"}}
