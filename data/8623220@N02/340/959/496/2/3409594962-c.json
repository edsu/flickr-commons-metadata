Absolutely.  See my comment on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3389738061/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3389738061/</a>.  These artillery exercises are all on what is still a sports field between the academy buildings and the water.\n\nI've been trying to find a current picture from the water.    Anyone who sails regularly into Annapolis uses the Academy Chapel , the State House, and St. Mary's as landmarks.  But you have to be pretty far away to see them all -- not likely to be a good photo.  The best I've found so far to prove where the exercises are happening are the panorama I link to from the photo mentioned above combined with <a href=\"http://travel.webshots.com/photo/2720983120013808429BvyNsp\">travel.webshots.com/photo/2720983120013808429BvyNsp</a>.    In this one, you are looking from a boat towards the eastern end of Dahlgren Hall (the armory).  The lights on  poles in front of Dahlgren Hall  illuminate the field where the artillery exercises are going on in the 1913 photo.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-3409594962-72157616355127253", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3409594962/#comment72157621559592158", "realname": "David Clow", "path_alias": "davidclow", "author": "7791881@N04", "iconserver": "219", "datecreate": "1247768868", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1144446@N23/\">Annapolis &amp; Eastport Historical Images</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "D.Clow - Maryland", "id": "8602872-3409594962-72157621559592158", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "3409594962"}}
