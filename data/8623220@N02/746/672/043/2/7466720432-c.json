The Tammany Society kept only one room for itself, renting the rest to entertainment impresarios: Don Bryant's Minstrels,a German theater company, classical concerts and opera. The basement \u2013 in the French mode \u2013 offered the Caf\u00e9 Ausant, where one could see tableux vivant, gymnastic exhibitions, pantomimes, and Punch and Judy shows. There was also a bar, a bazaar, a Ladies' Cafe, and an oyster saloon. All this \u2013 with the exception of Bryant's \u2013 was open from seven till midnight for a combination price of fifty cents.[47]\n \nThe building had an auditorium of sufficient size to hold public meetings, and a smaller one that became Tony Pastor's Music Hall, where vaudeville had its beginnings.[48]\n \nIn 1927 the building on 14th Street was sold, to make way for the new tower being added to the Consolidated Edison Company Building.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammany_Hall\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammany_Hall</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-7466720432-72157630425322378", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7466720432/#comment72157630448487738", "realname": "Arden", "path_alias": "arden_loc", "author": "35072786@N08", "iconserver": "3331", "datecreate": "1341578572", "_content": "artolog:  Thank you for your information about the first Tammany Hall headquarters building which is depicted in this image.
