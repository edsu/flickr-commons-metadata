She is very famous, but as far as I know, nobody knows who she is. I always thought solving her identity would be a fabulous project for forensic investigators and artists. I wish History Channel or someone else would take up that cause.\n\nPhotos of her were not pornographic. They were tasteful and artful. She had light eyes and baby teeth.This looks a lot like her to me. \n\nDoes anyone else know the person I am speaking of? Photos of her are widely distributed. She was very pretty. I would love to know if this is her.\n\nI painted a picture based on one of her photos. I usually recognize her. But the &quot;baby teeth&quot; effect might be from somebody altering her teeth. It looks like someone tried to darken her lip line. Too bad the photo has been messed with.", "authorname": "JellySunArt", "id": "8602872-4606569582-72157624059667928", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4606569582/#comment72157624060929756", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11418107@N02", "iconserver": "1068", "datecreate": "1273866724", "_content": "Wow, if you look at the larger size it seems the whole dress might be painted on--possibly the headgear too, although maybe that's just been altered.", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-4606569582-72157624060929756", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4606569582/#comment72157623964785691", "realname": "Briana Avalos", "path_alias": null, "author": "49627961@N03", "iconserver": "5307", "datecreate": "1274214957", "_content": "creepy", "authorname": "bri@nat@lking", "id": "8602872-4606569582-72157623964785691", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4606569582/#comment72157623975969723", "realname": "Zinaida Beaumont", "path_alias": null, "author": "37408767@N03", "iconserver": "3494", "datecreate": "1274360725", "_content": "Often pictures were tainted or coloured for postcards.
