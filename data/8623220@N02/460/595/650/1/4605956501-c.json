I have checked the (admittedly meagre) &quot;track and field&quot; online photo file on the University of Michigan's Bentley Historical Library website, and find no pix of anyone wearing shirts with this peculiar design, of three C's with an arrow through them. All true Michigan shirts have the famous block &quot;M&quot; logo on the front, and track at Michgan was called &quot;track,&quot; not cross country. Michigan is my alma mater, and I have lived in Ann Arbor for all of my 67 years. I have seen many U-Mich photos during those years, but never one like this, with three C's on the shirts. Maybe Bain's clerk wrote Mich. by mistake, intending to write &quot;Minn.,&quot; for Minnesota?\n\nWhile we're on the subject: Bain's caption reads &quot;Univ. Mich.,&quot; NOT &quot;Mich. U.,&quot; as the LOC title wantonly has it. &quot;Mich. U.&quot; is just plain WRONG, and leads to confusion with Michigan State University, the agricultural school in East Lansing (confusion which is all-too-frequent as it is).", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4605956501-72157623936128739", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4605956501/#comment72157624080988046", "realname": "Karen", "path_alias": "kchi_loc", "author": "34985608@N03", "iconserver": "3099", "datecreate": "1274123109", "_content": "We'll change it to Univ.
