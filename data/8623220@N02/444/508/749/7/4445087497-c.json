The dog is of the breed used by the Huns for police work and also for Red Cross scout duty.  It was originally in the German army, but, being, an especially intelligent animal and vigorously opposed to murderous Kaiserism, it boldly deserted to the English forces in the thick of battle.  Now the dog is thoroughly British, so much so that he dotes on making mincemeat of any dachshund he can find.

I read the review of Susan Orlean's Rin Tin Tin book in the New Yorker a few weeks ago.  His master's divorce from a woman who just couldn't compete with him for her husband's affection put me in mind of the joke: &quot;I got a dog for my husband. It was a really good trade!&quot;\n\nAt present, I'm immersed to my eyeballs in early 20th century show business history, in hot pursuit of something called &quot;the collie ballet,&quot; in which the father of my first wife appeared in 1910 (she died in 1991, and her father, Walter Burke, died in 1966, too soon for me to have met him).  Both the ballet and Mr. Burke were minor features of a smashingly successful musical called &quot;The Top o' th' World,&quot; which launched him on a thirty-year theater and vaudeville career.  The wonderful Dolly Sisters' routine, &quot;The Dollys and their collies,&quot; was a pale imitation of this act presented many years later.  Walter also happened to be a WWI pilot who was in training in Texas at the same time, or just after, Vernon Castle crashed and died there on a training flight in 1918.", "authorname": "MarvGilson", "id": "8602872-4445087497-72157627619466807", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4445087497/#comment72157632355012952", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1356602378", "_content": "If the January, 1914 on the negative is correct, though, the story of the &quot;German Traitor Dog&quot;  would seem to be made up by the press or Vernon C's management, since war didn't break out until August, 1914.\nIt's possible that Irene is holding her pet monkey in her right hand, as she is in this other Bain photo:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7949420400/\" title=\"Mrs. Vernon Castle (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8454/7949420400_18b3cc067c_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"175\" alt=\"Mrs. Vernon Castle (LOC)\" /></a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-4445087497-72157632355012952", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4445087497/#comment72157632358160784", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1356629884", "_content": "I think I figured this out.
