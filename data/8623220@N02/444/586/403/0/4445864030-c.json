After his death, his heirs ordered the hotel closed in September, 1913, then relented and granted it a reprieve, which is probably the news that triggered this photo.\n\nIn 1914 came another closing order; that too was reprieved. Then the kerfuffle in August, 1915. But the relief then was short lived. On November 10, 1915, the Fire Prevention Bureau shut the old vessel down for good, calling it a firetrap. [One reason was that all the doors opened inward.]\n\nFrom a website by a descendant of Stamler, who built the boat:\n\n&quot;Fortunately, the thirty-eight girls still living on the Stamler were found new homes on land. Arbuckle\u2019s sisters 'had investigated all the other hotels and found them suitable,' according to the Times, 'and would pay the expenses of moving for each girl.' The vessel\u2019s captain, cook, and other employees were promised new employment. The paper reported that 'many girls who used to live on the Stamler and have moved out because they got married or earned more money, came back for a last look at their old home, to laugh a little and cry a little with the girls who were leaving.'\n\n&quot;There are no extant records describing the Stamler\u2019s ultimate fate. It\u2019s rumored that she did ultimately burn in a fire, in 1916, at the foot of North Henry Street, but this is still unsubstantiated.&quot;", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4445864030-72157623686276668", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4445864030/#comment72157623562394975", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "29079609@N02", "iconserver": "5491", "datecreate": "1269467434", "_content": "well it's good to see th protests came to something after all", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-4445864030-72157623562394975", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4445864030/#comment72157623709735264", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1269640384", "_content": "A peek inside:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4464318581/]\n\nThe tidy kitchen:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4526078318/in/photostream/]\n\nA floating dormitory:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4465082040/in/photostream/]\n\nAnother exterior view:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4464303979/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4445864030-72157623709735264", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4445864030"}}
