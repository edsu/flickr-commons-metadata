As a member of the Democratic Party, he served in the state legislature and then as Lieutenant Governor (1913-1914) and then as the 46th Governor (1914-1916). His first term in the U.S. Senate (1919-1925) was followed by a brief hiatus from government, after which he was elected to the U.S. Senate four times, serving from 1926-1947.
