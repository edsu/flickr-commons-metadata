Items at auction included Gaynor's horses and farm animals, and drew a crowd of 1,000.\n\nThe J. E. Smith Haddens had an estate called Hempstead Farm, near Hempstead, Long Island, on Meadow Brook Road, not far from the Meadow Brook Hunt Club and polo grounds.\n\nThe woman in this photo probably is Mrs. Smith Hadden -- not &quot;Miss.&quot; Bain has mistaken her marital status.\n\nA NYT news item from 1899 recalls an earlier adventure of Mrs. J. E. Smith Hadden with a horse and an employee named John Kelly. [The John Kelly in this photo looks too big to have been a jockey.]\n\n&quot;MRS. J. E. SMITH HADDEN IN A RUNAWAY&quot;\n\n&quot;Hempstead, L. I. (April 8) Mrs. J. E. Smith Hadden's pony ran away today. A groom named Kelly was driving her through the village. Mrs. Hadden, who is a member of the Meadow Brook Hunt Club, and an expert horsewoman, jumped from the cart and escaped injury. Kelly could not stop the pony and was thrown out. His shoulder was dislocated. The pony ran into the wagon of George Sessions, and was stopped. The animal escaped injury.&quot;\n\n---New York Times, April 9, 1899.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4445875772-72157623679380770", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4445875772"}}
