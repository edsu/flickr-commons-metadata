Items at auction included Gaynor's horses and farm animals, and drew a crowd of 1,000.\n\nThe New York Times of January 28, 1892, reported the wedding of William Archer Thompson and Louise Schermerhorn Little. [They sound like the names of Edith Wharton characters.] Among the wedding guests was Miss Moller, and her mother, Mrs. Moller. Former (and future) President Grover Cleveland had been invited, but sent regrets.\n\nWhen this photo was taken, Mrs. Butler Duncan had been a widow for over a year. Her husband, William Butler Duncan II, had been a New York banker and president of a railroad before his death on March 30, 1912.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4445875276-72157623684611962", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4445875276/#comment72157623582383461", "realname": "Jeff", "path_alias": "jeff_loc", "author": "34997905@N03", "iconserver": "3319", "datecreate": "1269606224", "_content": "Richard: \nThanks for the correction.
