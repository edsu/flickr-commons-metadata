During his career, he played for the New York Highlanders (1905\u20131913), Chicago White Sox (1913\u20131914), Buffalo Blues (1914\u20131915), Cincinnati Reds (1916\u20131918), and New York Giants (1919).\n\nNo lesser figures than Babe Ruth and Walter Johnson named him the best first baseman ever, and contemporary reports describe his glovework as outstanding. He is sometimes considered the first true star of the franchise that would eventually become the New York Yankees. In 1981, 62 years after his last major league game, baseball historians Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.\n\nDespite being an excellent hitter and his reputation as a peerless defensive player, Chase's legacy was tainted by a litany of corruption. He allegedly gambled on baseball games, and also engaged in suspicious play in order to throw games in which he played", "authorname": "Film&PhotoArchivist", "id": "8602872-9319237625-72157634708379858", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9319237625/#comment72157634784493705", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "73985043@N02", "iconserver": "3667", "datecreate": "1374745284", "_content": "@", "authorname": "ptpt1#mmnn", "id": "8602872-9319237625-72157634784493705", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9319237625/#comment72157634784496307", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "73985043@N02", "iconserver": "3667", "datecreate": "1374745305", "_content": "@228", "authorname": "ptpt1#mmnn", "id": "8602872-9319237625-72157634784496307", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "9319237625"}}
