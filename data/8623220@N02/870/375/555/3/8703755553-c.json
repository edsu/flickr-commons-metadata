He was a pilot in the NC-3 flying boat. The attempt was lead by John Henry Towers.\n&quot;The flying expedition began on 8 May 1919 when three Curtiss NC Flying Boats, designated NC-1, NC-3 and NC-4, left Naval Air Station Rockaway, New York. The aircraft made intermediate stops in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, Chatham, Massachusetts and Halifax, Nova Scotia before reaching Trepassey, Newfoundland on 15 May 1919. On 16 May they left for the longest leg of their journey, to the Azores. NC-1 and the NC-3 were both forced to land in heavy seas due to dense fog, and neither could take off again. NC-1 subsequently began taking on water and the crew was rescued by the Greek freighter Ionia. The crew of the NC-3, including Towers, managed to keep the NC-3 afloat for 52 hours, water taxiing the craft over 200 miles to Punta Delgada on Sao Miguel Island. NC-4 went on to complete the transatlantic crossing, arriving at Lisbon on 27 May.&quot;\n(from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Towers\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Towers</a>)\n\nSee photo of the crew of the NC-3 on their arrival in Ponta Delgada.
