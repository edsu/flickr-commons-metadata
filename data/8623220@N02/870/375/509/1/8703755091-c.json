Frontier of India. He would have been in the Battle of Dargai (1897), but broke his leg before the campaign began and rejoined his command only after the fighting was over. This portrait must have been painted soon after his return to England in May 1898, on his appointment to command the Musketry School at Hythe. He later became commander of the Dardanelles Expeditionary Force 1915, and in 1920 published his two-volume Gallipoli Diary. Sir Ian was also a collector and bequeathed Sickert's \u2018St Mark's, Venice\u2019 (N05914) to the Tate Gallery.\nA three-quarter view head and shoulders portrait, 27 1/2\u00d720, inscribed \u2018To Mrs Ian Hamilton\u2019, was given by Lady Hamilton to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in 1941. The sitter wears khaki drill uniform and in the background are regimental colours.
