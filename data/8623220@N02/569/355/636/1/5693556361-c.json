Lavolti, were killed when his taxicab fell into a hole on the Rue St. Augustin. The incident occured during a three-hour storm &quot;of phenomenal violence&quot; on the night of Monday, June 15, 1914. Eyewitnesses saw the hand of a woman waving from one of the windows of the cab before it was covered by an avalanche of loose earth. Fourteen people died during the storm as sections of streets collapsed in several parts of the city. \n\nSeven thousand cab drivers attended Clop's funeral on Friday, June 19. According to the papers, &quot;Further subsidences occur daily, the latest, 200 feet long and 10 feet wide, being in Rue Moncey.&quot;  \n\nReferences: \n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F30F17FF3F5E13738DDDAF0994DE405B848DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York Times, June 16, 1914</a>\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F30F12FB385A12738DDDA90A94DE405B848DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York Times, June 20, 1914</a>\net al.", "authorname": "technogeo", "id": "8602872-5693556361-72157626663465552", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5693556361/#comment72157626548558865", "realname": "ARDIANTO PURWANTO", "path_alias": null, "author": "62602490@N07", "iconserver": "3114", "datecreate": "1304855890", "_content": "Mobil zaman dulu masih ada gak ya???", "authorname": "ARDIYOSI", "id": "8602872-5693556361-72157626548558865", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5693556361/#comment72157626684070640", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1304967652", "_content": "Thanks technogeo for uncovering the information about this catastrophe.
