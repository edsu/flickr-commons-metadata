The noun tirailleur, which translates as &quot;skirmisher&quot;, was a designation given by the French Army to indigenous infantry recruited in the various colonies and overseas possessions of the French Empire during the 19th and 20th centuries.\nDespite recruitment not being limited to Senegal, these infantry units took on the adjective &quot;s\u00e9n\u00e9galais&quot; since that was where the first black African Tirailleur regiment had been formed. The first Senegalese Tirailleurs were formed in 1857 and served France in a number of wars, including World War I (providing around 200,000 troops, more than 135,000 of whom fought in Europe and 30,000 of whom were killed) and World War II. Other tirailleur regiments were raised in French North Africa from the Arab and Berber populations of Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, they were called Tirailleurs alg\u00e9riens or Turcos. Tirailleur regiments were also raised in Indochina, they were called Vietnamese, Tonkinese or Annamites Tirailleurs.", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-6821070446-72157629548010835", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6821070446/#comment72157629183825330", "realname": "Leandro  Trujillo Casa\u00f1as", "path_alias": null, "author": "57601478@N03", "iconserver": "7145", "datecreate": "1331321710", "_content": "Una expresi\u00f3n angustiosa que lo dice todo, una foto que impresiona.", "authorname": "letrucas", "id": "8602872-6821070446-72157629183825330", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6821070446/#comment72157629184324166", "realname": "", "path_alias": "romantica1971", "author": "23194291@N07", "iconserver": "3745", "datecreate": "1331327038", "_content": "Genial, muy buena toma.\n\nSaludos", "authorname": "Lunaticaenlaluna1971", "id": "8602872-6821070446-72157629184324166", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6821070446/#comment72157629549625699", "realname": "Dee", "path_alias": "dees-nr1-pics", "author": "42710474@N07", "iconserver": "2635", "datecreate": "1331334609", "_content": "Powerful!", "authorname": "Sony Flick Chick", "id": "8602872-6821070446-72157629549625699", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6821070446/#comment72157629550457189", "realname": "", "path_alias": "oda2010", "author": "21691787@N06", "iconserver": "8265", "datecreate": "1331345768", "_content": "Una expresion que transmite todo..", "authorname": "oda 2012", "id": "8602872-6821070446-72157629550457189", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6821070446/#comment72157629552281873", "realname": "Amanda Carvalho", "path_alias": "amandacarvalho", "author": "34308082@N03", "iconserver": "3710", "datecreate": "1331375621", "_content": "he is afraid and sad..", "authorname": "Amanda Carvalho Fotografia", "id": "8602872-6821070446-72157629552281873", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6821070446/#comment72157629577912833", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "77556173@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1331659038", "_content": "Great!\n<img alt=\"Free counters!\" src=\"http://s10.flagcounter.com/mini/ldv/bg_FFFFFF/txt_FFFFFF/border_FFFFFF/flags_1/\" /><img alt=\"Free counters!\" src=\"http://s01.flagcounter.com/mini/8DD2/bg_FFFFFF/txt_FFFFFF/border_FFFFFF/flags_1\" /><img alt=\"Free counters!\" src=\"http://s01.flagcounter.com/mini/Sde/bg_FFFFFF/txt_FFFFFF/border_FFFFFF/flags_1/\" />", "authorname": "a98dele", "id": "8602872-6821070446-72157629577912833", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6821070446/#comment72157630598311860", "realname": "", "path_alias": "sunlitweb", "author": "80358170@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1342417847", "_content": "Yes, he looks afraid.
