From the Wikipedia article on HMS Lusitania:\n&quot;1915\nThe official warning issued by the Imperial German Embassy about travelling on Lusitania. \nBy early 1915 a new threat began to materialize: submarines. At first they were used by the Germans only to attack naval vessels, and they achieved only occasional \u2013 but sometimes spectacular \u2013 successes. Then the U-boats began to attack merchant vessels at times, although almost always in accordance with the old cruiser rules. Desperate to gain an advantage on the Atlantic, the German government decided to step up their submarine campaign. On 4 February 1915 Germany declared the seas around the British Isles a war zone: from 18 February allied ships in the area would be sunk without warning.&quot;\nThis was not wholly unrestricted submarine warfare since efforts would be taken to avoid sinking neutral ships.&quot;\n\nIt is definitely ironic that this very ship (under a French flag and named La Dives) was sunk by the Germans in January, 1918.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania#International_reaction\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania#International_reaction</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6821069798-72157629574361661", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6821069798/#comment72157629209685808", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "91829349@N00", "iconserver": "5466", "datecreate": "1331613939", "_content": "Could be.

As an example, the top of the card might say Christmas and below that is a list of inked numbers for negatives related to that topic.  (I'll check next week at the Library and see if I can find which subject card listed this negative and post it here.) \n\nWe also have a set of <b>caption cards</b> typed by LOC staff 40-50 years ago when they went through the negatives systematically. They combined and often shortened info found on the negative, the old paper sleeve for the negative, and the subject index. These typed cards are the source for the current captions you see in Flickr, even with their typos. \n\nIt's been great to have a &quot;positive&quot; version of the negative (the digitized image) and the caption card info side-by-side now for easier comparison.
