At the time of this photograph, the term Servian was in use in the U.S. and other English-speaking countries, and was used somewhat interchangeably with Serbian.  Here is one <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B0DE4D8133CE633A25750C1A9679D946396D6CF\">example</a> of the use of the phrase 'Servian Red Cross'  in the New York Times from November 1912.  \n\nAll that being said, it would be helpful to also add a reference to Serbia to this record for those searching by the more well-known name. We will do so and then reload the descriptive data to Flickr.", "authorname": "The Library of Congress", "id": "8602872-2636497040-72157606595381249", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2636497040"}}
