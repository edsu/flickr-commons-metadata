There is also an article in the New York Times from Jan 20, 1926 describing his marriage to Marie Harin. The article says she was a Russian aristocrat who fled the revolution and went to work for Near East Relief where she met Mr. Jaquith.

They numbered the negatives, and adhered to a chronological sequence most of the time, but there are these chunks of images from the 1920s that do crop up in the middle of an earlier sequence.  One day we'll crack the code as to why.  (When you see both an early date and a later date on one negative, we presume the later date could reflect the 'last used' date or the date of acquisition or purchase.)  It's an excellent question!", "authorname": "Kristi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-7314071500-72157630333979652", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7314071500"}}
