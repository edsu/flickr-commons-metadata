The SS-23 is the USS Skate, while the name at the bow of the boat pictured is the &quot;Carp&quot; (obviously scratched out). The Carp was designated the SS-20. The number on the conning tower is &quot;21,&quot; which seems to indicate that it is the USS Barracuda. However, the faint, presumably original, caption info at the bottom left indicates that this is indeed the SS-20. If this is true, then the 21 on the conning tower was added after the photo was taken in order to depict the Barracuda, and then later presented as the Skate. Of course, the Bain photo is merely a copy, and I do not believe that the Bain negative was altered.", "authorname": "LWyman", "id": "8602872-7314079190-72157630005559494", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7314079190/#comment72157630005971252", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "29079609@N02", "iconserver": "5491", "datecreate": "1338605995", "_content": "NY Times coverage of the wreck\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F70D12FE385C13738DDDAF0994DC405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F70D12FE385C13...</a>\n\nMaritimequest places this photo in San Francisco with those liners\n<a href=\"http://www.maritimequest.com/warship_directory/us_navy_pages/submarines/01_pages/f/f1_ss20_page_1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.maritimequest.com/warship_directory/us_navy_pages/sub...</a>", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-7314079190-72157630005971252", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7314079190/#comment72157630319506890", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1340835546", "_content": "LWyman,\n\nQuite a tangled web, isn't it?  I agree that it's definitely not the F-4, as the Bain caption states, and agree with you that it's most likely the Carp, Submarine #20 (and later SS-20, when the Navy implemented that naming scheme), which was renamed the F-1 while still under construction. The photo (a copy photo, as you said) has the caption of ...Submarine Boat No. 20, and I pulled the photo print of this image, and can read the word Carp just after that as well.  And just below, ...nion Iron Works, which should be Union Iron Works, where the F-1 and F-2 were constructed in San Francisco, CA.  I'm not too bothered by the 21 on the conning tower, only because the U.S. Navy shows the Barracuda F-2 with a 22 on its conning tower, even though it was Submarine #21, in <a href=\"http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-f/ss21.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">these photographs.</a> Confusing!  Anyway, we'll add the more likely identification of this sub as the F-1 (Submarine #20) when we update.  \n\nThanks for the detective work!", "authorname": "Kristi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-7314079190-72157630319506890", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7314079190/#comment72157630332121016", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "14651149@N00", "iconserver": "72", "datecreate": "1340912471", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/kristi_loc] Whoa, good points.
