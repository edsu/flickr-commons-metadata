Many photographs of the German front line were staged. The new manner of waging war with long-range artillery, not to mention the no-man\u2019s-land between opposing trench lines, made photographing battle scenes very difficult. As a result, photographs of still scenes (where exposure times were not an issue) circulated in far higher numbers than shots of active combat.\n<a href=\"http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=2125\" rel=\"nofollow\">germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=2125</a>", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-7314077454-72157630005861142", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7314077454/#comment72157630333228238", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1340918068", "_content": "Kilted Cowboy,\n\nThanks for the link to the information about photographer Alfred K\u00fchlewindt.
