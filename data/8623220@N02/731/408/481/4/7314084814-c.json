These two women were quite accomplished.  The date on the photo is April 3, 1915.  An article in the April 4, 1915 Hartford Courant (only available through subscription database) uses this Bain photograph to illustrate a brief article, stating the two ladies are graduates of Johns Hopkins, and were returning from nursing wounded in Serbia. The medals they wear in the photo were awarded to them by King Peter of Serbia for their service.  They return to the U.S. to raise money for Red Cross supplies to take back to Serbia two weeks later.  (Naturally, this experience and others is what led them to write the 1916 book pennylrichardsca mentions.)  \n\nWe will add more details about Miss Hansen and Miss Livingston with our next update.", "authorname": "Kristi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-7314084814-72157630303460106", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7314084814/#comment72157630304997136", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1340751110", "_content": "King Peter I of Serbia:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3047670355/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3025/3047670355_99ec50ea71_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"173\" alt=\"King Servia at Uskub (LOC)\" /></a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-7314084814-72157630304997136", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7314084814"}}
