Whitmore to organize and command the  New York Army National Guard 15th Infantry Regiment, which became the 369th Infantry Regiment, &quot;The Harlem Hellfighters&quot;.  They were a unit of Black enlisted men and some Black officers that had an extraordinary record in World War I combat and an extraordinary impact on civil rights for African-Americans.\n<a href=\"http://hnn.us/articles/89508.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">hnn.us/articles/89508.html</a>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/369th_U.S._Infantry_Regiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/369th_U.S._Infantry_Regiment</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/369th-infantry/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.archives.gov/education/lessons/369th-infantry/</a>\n&quot;HAYWARD TO FORM A NEGRO REGIMENT&quot; New York Times, June 26, 1916 <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990DEED7113FE233A25755C2A9609C946796D6CF&amp;scp=50&amp;sq=\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990DEED7113FE233A...</a>\n\n\n\n\nOn April 1, 1915, when the photo of three men was almost certainly taken, McCall was the chairman of the New York Public Service Commission (which was responsible for the major subway projects then underway), while Maltbie was a commissioner who had just been replaced against his will by New York Governor Charles Whitmore.  The governor wanted to sweep out the old Commission, and a committee to whom William Hayward was counsel was engaged in investigations of its practices.  McCall was replaced later in the year.  Colonel William Hayward  was arriving as Maltbie's appointed replacement.\n\nA New York Times article from April 2, 1915 describes the events of that day, and the apparent jocularity of the three men despite being part of this bitter dispute.\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950CE4DE153EE033A25751C0A9629C946496D6CF&amp;scp=32&amp;sq=maltbie&amp;st=p\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950CE4DE153EE033A...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-7314082490-72157630038646502", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7314082490"}}
