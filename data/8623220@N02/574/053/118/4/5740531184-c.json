He batted and threw right-handed.\n\nIn a seven-season career, Fultz posted a .271 batting average with 223 RBI and three home runs in 644 games played.\n\nIn 1912, he created a furor in baseball by unionizing major league players in an organization called the Players Fraternity. Ty Cobb and Christy Mathewson were among its officers. The group threatened to strike in 1917, but the walkout was averted after Fultz obtained some concessions for the players. The union was disintegrated during World War I.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fultz\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fultz</a>", "authorname": "Cynthia Wenslow", "id": "8602872-5740531184-72157626640795147", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5740531184/#comment72157626767230028", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1305935190", "_content": "Another Bain/LOC portrait of David Fultz:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5739969375/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-5740531184-72157626767230028", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5740531184/#comment72157626767942724", "realname": "", "path_alias": "geraldbrazell", "author": "36748621@N02", "iconserver": "5065", "datecreate": "1305944898", "_content": "I would never have thought him to be a baseball player from the photo.
