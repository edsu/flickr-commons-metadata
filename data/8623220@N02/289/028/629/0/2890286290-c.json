Unless this is another Bain error (not unthinkable), then this photo would depict Clifford Carlton &quot;Gavvy&quot; Cravath (1881-1963), a native of Escondido, California (some sources cite Poway, a nearby settlement), who played for the Phillies from 1912 through the end of his career in 1920. Previously he had played for the Red Sox, White Sox, and Senators, as well as playing semi-pro and minor league ball.\n\n<a href=\"http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;bid=950&amp;pid=2979\">Here's a biography of Gavvy Cravath</a> from the Baseball Biography Project website.\n\nIn case the Bain negative caption is wrong and this is actually Dode Paskert, here's some stuff about him, too:\n\nGeorge Henry &quot;Dode&quot; Paskert (1881-1959) was a native of Cleveland, Ohio. He began playing in the minor leagues in 1904, and following three seasons in Dayton, Ohio, he played one season in Atlanta before starting his major league career with the Cincinnati Reds. He joined the Philadelphia Phillies in 1911, went to the Chicago Cubs in 1918, and returned to the Reds for his final season in 1921.\n\nThe Baseball Biography Project has <a href=\"http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;bid=946&amp;pid=10926\">a fairly extensive biography of Dode Paskert</a>.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-2890286290-72157607524181390", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2890286290"}}
