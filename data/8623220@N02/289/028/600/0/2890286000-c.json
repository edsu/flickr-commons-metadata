Before joining the NL they had been variously known as the Atlantics, the Greys, the Grooms, and the Bridegrooms.\n\nIf this photo dates from 1913, as indicated above, then the team was called the Brooklyn Superbas at the time. This was the name the team had adopted on joining the NL in 1899. They used the name Dodgers during the 1912 season (and maybe 1911- sources differ), but returned to their earlier name for the 1913 season. In 1914 they became the Brooklyn Robins, and then restored the name Dodgers in 1916. \n\nHowever, some sources say the team officially remained the Robins into the early 1930s. That the name Robins did continue in use at least into the 1920s is shown by various New York Times articles (such as <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980DE6D91731EF33A25750C2A9619C946095D6CF\">this article of July 23, 1921</a>) that use the names Robins and Dodgers interchangeably.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-2890286000-72157607526687958", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2890286000"}}
