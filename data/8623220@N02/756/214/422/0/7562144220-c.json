Highsmith.  I was honored when the staff at the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division requested that I photograph the Thomas Jefferson Building.  Digital cameras had finally reach the place where they could put out the quality of a large format 4x5 film camera.  I had raced out to buy one and I wanted to try it out on something magnificent.  It was a 39 mega pixel Phase One Camera and we were all impressed with the outcome.  It would have been difficult to photograph some of the art that was high up in the ceiling with a large cumbersome camera.", "authorname": "Carol M.Highsmith", "id": "8602872-7562144220-72157630581134440", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7562144220"}}
