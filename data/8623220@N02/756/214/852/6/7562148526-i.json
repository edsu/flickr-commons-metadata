The importance of electricity is celebrated throughout the Jefferson Building. A bust of Benjamin Franklin is placed outside the central window of the Jefferson Building. Franklin was not only a statesman but also a scientist who made important discoveries about electricity. When the building was completed in 1897, the United States was eager to celebrate many American inventions made practicable by scientific advances relating to electricity. These include the telegraph, the telephone, electric motors and lighting devices, and the elevator. The bare light bulbs throughout the building show how important the introduction of electric light was to America and this building.&quot; (Source: MyLOC.gov Great Hall exhibit, 2008)\nTitle devised by Library staff.\nForms part of the Library of Congress Series in the Carol M.
