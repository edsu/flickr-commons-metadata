This Memorial Arch shows a young student seeking knowledge through reading. On the right an older man with flowing beard is shown absorbed in meditation, no longer concerned so much with a source of learning because the old man observes life and engages in original reflection and thought.  Along the frieze are [the] words &quot;Library of Congress,&quot; inscribed in tall gilt letters. A second inscription names those involved in the building of the Library. The text reads: Erected Under the Acts of Congress of  April 15, 1886; October 2, 1888; and March 2, 1889 by  Brig. Gen. Thos. Lincoln Casey  Chief of Engineers U.S.A.  Bernard R. Green Supt. and Engineer  John L. Smithmeyer Architect  Paul J.
