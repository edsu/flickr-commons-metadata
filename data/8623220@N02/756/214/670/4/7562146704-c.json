Highsmith.  I was chosen to photograph the interior of the Thomas Jefferson Building.  It took me quite some time to get a handle on all of the facets of art  in the Great Hall.  As you can see, even the ceiling has artistic details.  I would take an image, then go home and study it on my computer up close.  Just walking around in the Thomas Jefferson building is an experience and it is difficult to take it all in because there are artistic statements everywhere.", "authorname": "Carol M.Highsmith", "id": "8602872-7562146704-72157630762945444", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7562146704"}}
