When the building was being constructed during the 1890s, aluminum was more precious than silver. The scale-pattern design of the six large skylights echoes that of the marble flooring beneath.&quot; (Source: MyLOC.gov Great Hall exhibit, 2008)\nTitle devised by Library staff.\nForms part of the Library of Congress Series in the Carol M.
