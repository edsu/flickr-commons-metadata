Detail of putti (gardener with a spade and a rake) on the Grand staircase by Philip Martiny.

A putto (plural putti) is a figure of a pudgy human baby, almost always male, often naked and having wings, found especially in Italian Renaissance art.  The four bottom figures include:  A Gardener, with spade and rake;  An Entomologist, with a specimen box slung over his shoulder, running to catch a butterfly in his net;  A Student, with a book in his hand and a mortar board on his head;  A Printer, with types, a press, and a type case.  The four top figures include:  A Musician, with a lyre by his side, studying pages of a music book;  A Physician, grinding drugs in a mortar, with a distilling vessel beside him, and the serpent sacred to medicine;  An Electrician, with a star of electric rays shining on his brow and a telephone receiver at his ear;  An Astronomer, with a telescope and a globe, encircled by the signs of the zodiac that he is measuring by the aid of a pair of compasses.&quot; (Source: MyLOC.gov Great Hall exhibit, 2008)\nTitle devised by Library staff.\nForms part of the Library of Congress Series in the Carol M.
