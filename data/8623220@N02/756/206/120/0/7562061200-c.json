Highsmith.  I took this image of the Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building from the dome of the United States Capitol.  As you can see, it was taken years ago because the Dome of the Thomas Jefferson Building is now a copper color.  I love to take images that I know one day will change.  Even though I am working everyday during my lifetime in the 20th and 21st Century, Many images I take will change over time.  The dome of the Jefferson Building changed color when the restoration was completed in the 1980s.", "authorname": "Carol M.Highsmith", "id": "8602872-7562061200-72157630573285246", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7562061200"}}
