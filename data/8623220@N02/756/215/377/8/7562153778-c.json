Highsmith.  I am documenting America so that my images can be donated copyright-free to the Library of Congress.  See my Web site: <a href=\"http://www.CarolHighsmithAmerica.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.CarolHighsmithAmerica.com</a>. I feel that aerial photography is important because it is a time stamp.  I have flown by helicopter over Washington, D.C. for years.\nOne cannot hire a helicopter to fly over the city, you need to go through a government agency.  I was doing some aerial work for the National Park Service and I was able to look down on the entire Library of Congress complex.  I have a gyroscope so that the images are sharp.  I was thrilled to be able to show the Thomas Jefferson building from a unique perspective.", "authorname": "Carol M.Highsmith", "id": "8602872-7562153778-72157630565643040", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7562153778/#comment72157630569681750", "realname": "Zinaida Beaumont", "path_alias": null, "author": "37408767@N03", "iconserver": "3494", "datecreate": "1342264967", "_content": "I have never seen it like that\nGreat view and great building", "authorname": "Zinaida Beaumont (very busy)", "id": "8602872-7562153778-72157630569681750", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7562153778/#comment72157630605911902", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "8652182@N06", "iconserver": "3402", "datecreate": "1342458590", "_content": "One of my favorite places!
