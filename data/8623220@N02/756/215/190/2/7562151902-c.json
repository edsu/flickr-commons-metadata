Highsmith.  I photographed the art on the wall of the Thomas Jefferson Building at the Library of Congress for two years working as many Sundays as I could.  I was able to get on a lift and take it high up so that I could access the art.  I was delighted to see the work up close and donate the images copyright-free to the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division. Much of the art represents our life.  This is Tragedy in the Literature series by George R. Barse, Jr.  I'm sure he would be happy now that the art is more accessible to  viewer.  I am honored to be featured in the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division and Flickr.", "authorname": "Carol M.Highsmith", "id": "8602872-7562151902-72157630565694812", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7562151902"}}
