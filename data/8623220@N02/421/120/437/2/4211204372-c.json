I do however agree that the mountains in the BG look the same, just reversed and the tower matches.\n\nAlso was wondering....seems in the forefront is an ice skating area.  One person looks like there is a reflection there and it looks like the snow is pushed back and there is a path from the &quot;road&quot; to the ice.  Does St. Mortiz fit this?  Just curious.
