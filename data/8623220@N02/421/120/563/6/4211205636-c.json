Presumably the upper stories of the wings of the building were altered and the chimneys were capped when a more modern heating system was installed.  It is hard to tell if the roof was raised, or if that's an illusion created by the angle of the photos, but if that did happen, perhaps it was to create room for the upgraded mechanical systems.  It would make sense, if that level of renovation was being completed, to redesign an overhanging roof for better drainage, too.", "authorname": "miscelena", "id": "8602872-4211205636-72157623079795664", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4211205636/#comment72157623079806734", "realname": "", "path_alias": "miscelena", "author": "46967716@N00", "iconserver": "5331", "datecreate": "1261929421", "_content": "That's all merely informed speculation, btw.
