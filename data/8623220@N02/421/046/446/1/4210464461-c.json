I found the below photographs of Sinan's tomb in the S\u00fcleymaniye complex, Istanbul (ca. 1980) at the Archnet: Islamic Architecture Community digital library.   The structures do not resemble the photochrom image: \n<a href=\"http://archnet.org/library/images/one-image.jsp?location_id=4395&amp;image_id=136965\" rel=\"nofollow\">archnet.org/library/images/one-image.jsp?location_id=4395...</a>  \n<a href=\"http://archnet.org/library/images/one-image.jsp?location_id=4395&amp;image_id=136964\" rel=\"nofollow\">archnet.org/library/images/one-image.jsp?location_id=4395...</a>\n\nHowever, according to the book The age of Sinan: Architectural culture in the Ottoman Empire (G\u00fclru Necipo\u011flu, 2005,  p. 150), Sinan endowed a masjid (mosque) and school with a public fountain in Yenibahc\u0327e (now Fatih), Istanbul. The original masjid burned in 1918 and was restored in 1976. The photographs of the current building, show windows resembling the windows in the building in the above image, but differ in other ways:\n<a href=\"http://www.sinanasaygi.org/en/eserler.asp?action=eserDetay&amp;ID=128\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sinanasaygi.org/en/eserler.asp?action=eserDetay&amp;I...</a>  \n\nIt would be exciting if we could confirm that the photochrom image shows Sinan\u2019s masjid before the fire of 1918.  What do you think? Thanks for encouraging us to dig deeper!", "authorname": "Arden (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-4210464461-72157627302579594", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4210464461/#comment72157627789230542", "realname": "Caner Cang\u00fcl", "path_alias": "caner", "author": "10069721@N00", "iconserver": "3672", "datecreate": "1317416552", "_content": "It is the part of Koca Sinan Pasha Complex, sebil (fountain) and tomb.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/caner/4559677873/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4062/4559677873_734067f575.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" alt=\"Koca Sinan Pa\u015fa T\u00fcrbe ve Sebili\" /></a>", "authorname": "~caner", "id": "8602872-4210464461-72157627789230542", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4210464461/#comment72157627709394503", "realname": "Arden", "path_alias": "arden_loc", "author": "35072786@N08", "iconserver": "3331", "datecreate": "1317933530", "_content": "~caner:  Thank you for posting the picture of the Koca Sinan Pasha Complex.
