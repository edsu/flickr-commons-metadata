The River Wye in this area shows examples of this and various other classic geomorphological features (e.g. the river is 'incised' and 'superimposed').  The bedrock geology of the Carboniferous (Misissippian) Limetone exposed in the cliffs here, and also seen in other Chepstow postcards posted here, is also of geological interest.
