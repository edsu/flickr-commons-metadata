The genetic material showed without doubt that Targett is a direct descendant through his mother's line of the skeleton known as Cheddar Man, which was found in 1903 in caves in Cheddar Gorge in southwest England.", "authorname": "Renira1", "id": "8602872-8435709194-72157632666279638", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8435709194/#comment72157632666676819", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66311327@N05", "iconserver": "7333", "datecreate": "1359798416", "_content": "<a href=\"https://maps.google.ch/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=51.284155,-2.762777&amp;panoid=d8AAyerPWxqj-IKqax1Ebg&amp;cbp=13,170.11,,0,-16.44&amp;source=embed&amp;ll=51.283234,-2.762053&amp;spn=0.002107,0.00603&amp;z=17\" rel=\"nofollow\">Street View</a>", "authorname": "B-59", "id": "8602872-8435709194-72157632666676819", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "8435709194"}}
