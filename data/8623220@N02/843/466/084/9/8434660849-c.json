Much of the coast consists of high cliffs, and access to the shore is often limited to small winding lanes and roads, and some of it only accessible on foot or by boat.  So it is quite a 'secret' coast. For this reason it is relatively undeveloped and unspoilt, even 'wild', and the few holiday resorts are quite small. The SW England Coast Path now gives foot access to all of it.", "authorname": "Darkroom Daze", "id": "8602872-8434660849-72157632705296787", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "8434660849"}}
