The genetic material showed without doubt that Targett is a direct descendant through his mother's line of the skeleton known as Cheddar Man, which was found in 1903 in caves in Cheddar Gorge in southwest England.", "authorname": "Renira1", "id": "8602872-8434625981-72157632666275120", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "8434625981"}}
