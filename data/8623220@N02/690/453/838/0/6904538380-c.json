By the beginning of the First World\nWar there were three tented camps known as Durrington, Larkhill, and Fargo Camps; which\nwere later replaced by permanent brick buildings. The military expansion caused a decline\nin all types of farming as the army occupied most of the land, however, the rapid rise in\npopulation brought about the establishment of many shops and business. After the Second\nWorld War the town expanded between Netheravon Road and the river Avon, including\nlarge council estates and two new schools. Durrington remains as an army-orientated\ncommunity.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/south_wiltshire_settlement_setting_assessment_2008_chapter_4_amesbury__bulford_and_durrington.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.wiltshire.gov.uk/south_wiltshire_settlement_setting_a...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6904538380-72157629644353492", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6904538380"}}
