Joseph Parker Kirlin (1861-1927) was a Scranton-born attorney, specializing in maritime law. Mrs. Kirlin was the former Elizabeth Burt of Detroit. Cletus Keating (1891-) was also a lawyer. They raised at least four children together: Cletus Jr., Anne, Parker, and Marshall. (Cletus Jr., b 1916, seems to have been the child of his father's first, brief marriage to Maud Scott, who died in 1917.)", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-7609305952-72157630719785266", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "7609305952"}}
