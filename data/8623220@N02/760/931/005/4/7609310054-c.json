Helen Buck was staying with the Heilners in Brooklyn, earning her keep as companion to Julia Heilner (who was &quot;an invalid,&quot; and is the woman on the right in the photo above).  She went out visiting on 23 April 1915; when she came back, she saw the family's newly hired butler, Joseph Hanel, leaving the house with a parcel and wearing one of Selig Heilner's nephew's collars. She asked a hired man from the neighborhood to go into the house; he found Julia Heilner beaten and strangled in the pantry.  The address of the crime scene was 217 Albemarle Road.\n\nAlmost a year later, in February 1916, Joseph E. Hanel was arrested in Baltimore and extradited back to New York.  He claimed to have an accomplice who did the murder, and would only admit to robbing the Heilners, but some of Hanel's fingerprints were found on the beer bottle used against Mrs. Heilner.  (Some of the Heilners' property turned up in pawnshops in Philadelphia.)\n\nSeligman L. Heilner was president of the Princess Corset Company.", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-7609310054-72157630667701386", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7609310054/#comment72157630780615910", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1343426659", "_content": "pennylrichardsca,\n\nThanks for shedding light on the tragic story behind the trio in this photograph.
