Thaw pulled a gun, fired three shots, and murdered the noted architect Stanford White, in the roof garden atop New York City's old Madison Square Garden [which White had designed], in full public view of a partygoing crowd. He was found insane, and committed to the Mattewan State Hospital for the Insane, in Fishkill, New York. In 1913, Thaw escaped from Mattewan, and met a confederate who drove him north across the New Hampshire border into Coaticook, Quebec, where he spent several weeks. After extradition from Canada, he was held briefly in New Hampshire, pending his return to the custody of the State of New York. After another trial, in 1915 he was adjudged to have been restored to sanity, and set free.\n\nThaw in New Hampshire -- a solo portrait:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4389397079/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4390172636-72157623392277421", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4390172636/#comment72157623535181062", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anne_loc", "author": "35014516@N03", "iconserver": "3087", "datecreate": "1267472686", "_content": "Richard Arthur Norton and Wystan: Thanks for your comments.
