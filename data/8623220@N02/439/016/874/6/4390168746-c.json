C., in a colorful ceremony attended by an actor costumed as the legendary Buffalo Bill Cody, recalling the 1913 American visit of the prince's great-grandfather (and namesake), who was hosted by Buffalo Bill on a hunting expedition near Cody, Wyoming, that lasted for several weeks. Among other fauna, the first Prince Albert (then Monaco's reigning monarch) killed a black bear and an elk. He also expressed a wish that he could serve as Mayor of Cody, Wyoming -- had he not already been burdened with other duties back in Monte Carlo.\n\nDuring an 80th anniversary visit in 1993, Albert II (whose mother was the American actress Grace Kelly) toured the site in Wyoming, which is near the east entrance of Yellowstone Park. Although crumbling, Buffalo Bill's old log hunting lodge still stands, and is now a tourist attraction; a dinner for Albert II was held inside.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4390168746-72157623537240394", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4390168746/#comment72157623530329369", "realname": "lifeasdaddy ...a guy, his wife, and their son...", "path_alias": "lifeasdaddy", "author": "13267298@N00", "iconserver": "3144", "datecreate": "1269064109", "_content": "Here they are dismounted:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4445862296/\">www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4445862296/</a>", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "8602872-4390168746-72157623530329369", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4390168746/#comment72157623663806250", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1269189220", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4445862296]", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-4390168746-72157623663806250", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4390168746/#comment72157625392210667", "realname": "lady tate", "path_alias": "ladytate1", "author": "56596665@N02", "iconserver": "3689", "datecreate": "1291344761", "_content": "you people are wonderful!", "authorname": "thejbach", "id": "8602872-4390168746-72157625392210667", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4390168746"}}
