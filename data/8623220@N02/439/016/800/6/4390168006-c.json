Annabel Angus True Alexander French, Lady de Freyne, was born in Scotland, daughter of an innkeeper.  She was working at a hotel in London when she met her third husband, Captain Arthur Reginald French, the 5th Baron de Freyne of Coolhaven (1879-1915)--they married in 1902.  Her origins weren't widely known until Lord de Freyne disappeared in 1905, on a visit to New York.  He apparently joined the US Army &quot;to gain experience of the world,&quot; and sometimes sent her letters over the years, from various American cities.  He died in battle during WWI.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_French,_5th_Baron_de_Freyne\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_French,_5th_Baron_de_Freyne</a>\n\nNot much later, Lady Annabel's troubled son from her first marriage, Major Ronald True (b. 1891) was convicted of killing a young woman, Olive Young (aka Gertrude Yates).  He had a history of other crimes, including forgery in the US, and desertion from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.   True was found insane and placed in an asylum instead of being executed as he was originally sentenced.
