Friend Floyd Dell noted wryly, \u201cshe couldn\u2019t even do so conventional a thing as get married, without creating a terrific sensation.\u201d  She was suspended for more than a year.

I ran into Henrietta Rodman in an earlier project on the married-women-teachers ban, so I was excited to see her come up, and it was easy to find my old sources on her to share here.  She's quite a character, plenty of news stories about her doings.  And she knew a lot of the 1910s bohemian set in Greenwich Village, so she turns up on the margins of a lot of biographies and memoirs covering that era.   If I get a chance, I'll gin up a wikipedia entry for her soon.", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-6358161543-72157628117033025", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "6358161543"}}
