Fascinating indeed.\nThere's no cathedral in this photo btw. The building to the right is known as the nieuwe kerk, i.e. the new church and although it's an impressive building, it's not a cathedral. As far as I know there has never been a catholic cathedral in Amsterdam; the see of the diocese of Haarlem-Amsterdam is located in the city of Haarlem.", "authorname": "jerome86", "id": "8602872-4120067264-72157622854064498", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4120067264/#comment72157622748407815", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "44972071@N05", "iconserver": "2741", "datecreate": "1259135551", "_content": "i like this very niec &gt;_&lt;", "authorname": "\u2022\u2022~\u00a4 \u1e68\u01d6\u1e56\u0119\u042f \u1e3e\u0113\u1e42\u1edf\u1ee2\u1edf", "id": "8602872-4120067264-72157622748407815", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4120067264/#comment72157622749513671", "realname": "Philip Menke", "path_alias": "milliped", "author": "34044399@N00", "iconserver": "23", "datecreate": "1259155640", "_content": "featuring \n&quot;naatje op de dam\ndie moest wijken\nvoor de elektrieken tram&quot;", "authorname": "milliped", "id": "8602872-4120067264-72157622749513671", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4120067264/#comment72157622774918641", "realname": "Maresa", "path_alias": "maresado", "author": "29784829@N04", "iconserver": "8204", "datecreate": "1259516600", "_content": "bella!!", "authorname": "Maresado", "id": "8602872-4120067264-72157622774918641", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4120067264/#comment72157627179128203", "realname": "Joanne Paleczny", "path_alias": "joanne_paleczny", "author": "29342764@N04", "iconserver": "3292", "datecreate": "1311886638", "_content": "was the statue in the center moved back, or is my photo closer up?\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joanne_paleczny/5897556939/in/photostream\">www.flickr.com/photos/joanne_paleczny/5897556939/in/photo...</a>", "authorname": "Jwaan", "id": "8602872-4120067264-72157627179128203", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4120067264/#comment72157627609919059", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "57544135@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1316781321", "_content": "@Jwaan  this statue was removed in 1914 the current statue was placed in 1956 and is called the National Monument and its build to remember the dutch casualties of World War II and all following armed conflicts with dutch involvement.
