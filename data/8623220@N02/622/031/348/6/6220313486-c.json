S. President James Abram Garfield. An Ohio lawyer and politician, he was Secretary of the Interior under President Theodore Roosevelt from 1907-09. He was a strong supporter of Roosevelt's (unsuccesful) 1912 bid for a third term as President, on the Progressive Party ticket. In the fall of 1914, when this photo was taken, Garfield was running for Lieutenant Governor of Ohio on the Progressive ticket. Former President Roosevelt, recently returned from a harrowing exploration of the Amazon jungle, apparently was campaigining for him. (Garfield lost the election.)\n\nWikipedia on James Rudolph Garfield:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rudolph_Garfield\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rudolph_Garfield</a>\n\nArthur L. Garford, millionaire Ohio industrialist, was born in Elyria, Ohio -- near Cleveland, Garfield's home town. In 1892, Garford patented an improved bicycle saddle: a padded seat for the new &quot;safety&quot; bicycles, with much more comfort that the primitive seats on the old high-wheelers. Soon his company was selling a million bicycle seats a year. In the early 1900s, he partnered with Studebaker to manufacture an automobile, the Studebaker-Garford, but it ceased production in 1911. Garford may have been in this photo because he was bankrolling Garfield's political bid.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-6220313486-72157627841713012", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6220313486/#comment72157627753108215", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anne_loc", "author": "35014516@N03", "iconserver": "3087", "datecreate": "1318428880", "_content": "Wystan:  Thanks for providing us with full names for these men.
