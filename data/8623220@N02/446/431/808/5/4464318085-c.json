Cleveland had been a resident of Princeton, New Jersey, from 1897, the end of his second term as President, until his death in 1908. He also served as a Trustee of Princeton University. The bells of the carrillon were not added until 1927 -- a gift of the Princeton Class of 1892. The tower was dedicated in a ceremony on October 22, 1913, at which former President William Howard Taft was the principal speaker.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4464318085-72157623709799062", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4464318085/#comment72157623711399318", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1269665729", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Tower\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Tower</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-4464318085-72157623711399318", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4464318085/#comment72157623588583579", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1269698444", "_content": "Dedication of the Cleveland Memorial Tower:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4464319223/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4464318085-72157623588583579", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4464318085/#comment72157623612168471", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1269981713", "_content": "Thanks Wystan for the information about the tower.
