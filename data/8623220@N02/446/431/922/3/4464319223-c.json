This is Wednesday, October 20, 1913, and William Howard Taft, who had left the Presidency on March 4 (when Woodrow Wilson, former president of Princeton University, succeeded him) is now Kent Professor of Law at Yale University (a post he will fill until 1921). He has returned to Princeton University to dedicate the Cleveland Tower, a memorial to former U. S. President Grover Cleveland, who had made his home in Princeton, N.J., from 1897 (when his second Presidential term ended) until his death in 1908. Taft will conclude the dedication ceremony by delivering an oration on the life and career of Grover Cleveland. The tower is visible behind this group of scholars, which includes John Grier Hibben (1861-1933), who was president of Princeton University from 1912 to 1932.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4464319223-72157623711101518", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4464319223/#comment72157623711381434", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1269665384", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grier_Hibben\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grier_Hibben</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-4464319223-72157623711381434", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4464319223/#comment72157623713125488", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1269698303", "_content": "A damaged Bain/LOC photograph of the Cleveland Memorial Tower:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4464318085/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4464319223-72157623713125488", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4464319223/#comment72157623591851823", "realname": "erna marcus", "path_alias": "ernamarcus", "author": "56812698@N00", "iconserver": "5498", "datecreate": "1269737066", "_content": "wow! the LOC is lucky to have you checking and correcting,  Sir Wystan.
