These sets were then taken to various locations around the state by the police.

The chest piece is missing some of the parts that Ned Kelly built into his original. This includes holes for shoulder straps and a curved edge of the lower edge from by the original shape of the mouldboard or plough. The iron skirt is attached by two, not one strap. In addition, the replica seems to have a extra back skirt panel. The shoulder pads were designed to protect the upper arm and from what I can see they were not bolted on to protect the top of the shoulder.\n\nMy guess is that somebody had some fun reconstructing this from a drawing in a newspaper. It would be interesting to see how accurate the newspaper drawings were and if any depicts these same errors.\n\nIf anybody is curious, there is also a good video here that details a suit of armor used by these bush-rangers.\n<a href=\"http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/collections/treasures/kelly_armour/kellyvideo.html\">www.slv.vic.gov.au/collections/treasures/kelly_armour/kel...</a>", "authorname": "plakboek", "id": "8602872-3029428883-72157609248695280", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3029428883/#comment72157626460800930", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "90719112@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1302360046", "_content": "My research also suggests that this is a replica.
