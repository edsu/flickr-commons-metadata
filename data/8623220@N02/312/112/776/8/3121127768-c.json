Located in the San Joaquin Valley, about equidistant from Los Angeles and San Francisco, Visalia was already a thriving community of more than 1,000 inhabitants. Orval's father, Daniel, was a well-to-do businessman who owned the Palace Hotel in addition to a citrus farm, and Orval enjoyed an upper-class upbringing. After pitching and playing first base at Visalia High School, the 19-year-old Overall enrolled at the University of California-Berkeley in the fall of 1900. He excelled in his studies of agricultural science and was elected president of the freshman class.\n\nOverall was a star in both football and baseball at Cal. On the gridiron he played guard, fullback, and punter on the varsity, serving as captain as a senior. In his junior and senior years he played integral roles in California's victories over archrival Stanford. In baseball Orval performed the majority of the mound work as a freshman, pitching well but suffering from occasional mental lapses. Perhaps an early indicator of the arm troubles that would plague him in later years, he missed time from pitching due to a sore arm in both his sophomore and junior seasons. During those times Overall played left field, first base, and sometimes even catcher, though he inevitably returned to pitching as the seasons wore on and his arm rounded into shape. In his junior year he entertained an offer to play baseball for a living with the San Francisco club of the Pacific Coast League, but he decided to continue his education instead.</i>", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-3121127768-72157611810412749", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3121127768/#comment72157611949439340", "realname": "", "path_alias": "vc_vigilant", "author": "52027278@N00", "iconserver": "38", "datecreate": "1230731198", "_content": "May you all have a blessed, warm, and Happy New Year!!!\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/vc_vigilant/3152849175/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3223/3152849175_9cdd7ee751_m.jpg\" width=\"187\" height=\"240\" alt=\"May You Keep The Home Fires Burning in 2009!!!\" /></a>", "authorname": "Jeff Holbrook", "id": "8602872-3121127768-72157611949439340", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3121127768/#comment72157624978110728", "realname": "Suzanne", "path_alias": null, "author": "28333802@N04", "iconserver": "5456", "datecreate": "1284767306", "_content": "Orval was my great-uncle.
