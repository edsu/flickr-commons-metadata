They had one daughter together. The marriage was a very unhappy one. He was a very depressed young man with a tendency to morbidity. He had a string of girlfriends, some of them prostitutes. According to one of them, a girl named Mizzi Caspar, he had asked her once if she would die with him. She turned him down, shocked and afterwards tended to think that he had made a joke. Apparently he had thoughts of suicide even years prior to his death. Freiin Mary Vetsera was barely 17 years old at the time of her death (Rudolf was 30). She was introduced to him by his cousin, Countess Larisch. Mary had been &quot;starstruck&quot; with the crown prince for a while. She did anything he asked her to. Even to die with him ... Rudolf took Mary to his hunting castle Mayerling, where their bodies were found behind a locked door on January 30th 1889, both with a bullet to their heads. Conspiracy theories abound about it being a murder that had been covered up. I tend to think it had been suicide. Rudolf never got along with his father, the emperor Franz Josef and was even said to have been offered the crown of Hungary, should that country try to ceceed from Austria-Hungary. That would have been high treason and even though the relationship was completely deteriorated, Rudolf apparently had huge qualms over it. That and the fact that he was depressed for years must have triggered his escape from life. At least that's what I think ...", "authorname": "LuisePrussia", "id": "8602872-3121121328-72157632744141191", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3121121328/#comment72157632749138152", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "92436196@N06", "iconserver": "8211", "datecreate": "1360630598", "_content": "I do have a picture of Mary Vetsera, taken in 1888.
