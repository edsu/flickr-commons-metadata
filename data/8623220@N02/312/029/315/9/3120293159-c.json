I checked a file of photographs here in the Prints and Photographs Division and found the photographic print Bain apparently copied from: a card photograph issued by Elliott &amp; Fry of London.  The identification that came with the print confirms the details.  It seems the photo was topical because Bull had just been named to succeed Bonar Law as leader of the Liberals in Parliament; the caption bears the date Jan. 6, 1913.
