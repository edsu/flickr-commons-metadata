S. President Ulysses S. Grant. In the 1912 election he broke with the Republican Party of his father and was strong in support of the Democratic Party and its candidate, Woodrow Wilson. He was in the news on this particular day, July 24, 1913, because on the preceding day, in Goldfield, Nevada, he had filed for divorce from his wife Elizabeth, then living in California, whom he had not seen for over two years. Divorce was unusual in 1913, and of course a scandal when it touched the lives of the mighty or their heirs. Incidentally, the suit for divorce was denied.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-3820614622-72157622061733154", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3820614622/#comment72157622061746632", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1250492063", "_content": "LOC --- the middle initial J in your title of the above photo is incorrect (notice how the J had been blotted out already on the Bain photo).
