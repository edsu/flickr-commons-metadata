The mystery of the difference in the image dates and the Mare Island event are now solved, as well as why the event was one year off from the generally chronological order of the Bain photos. The image I linked to above, of course, is from the Mare Island event in October, 1916.\n\nA ship's history provided by the New Mexico Council of the Navy League of the United States has this to say about the building of the ship, which was ultimately involved in many battles in the Pacific Theater of WWII:\n\n&quot;Authorized by an Act of Congress dated June 30, 1914, construction of Battleship 40 was allocated to the Brooklyn Navy Yard and begun in October 1915. At first scheduled to bear the name CALIFORNIA, the huge finished product was officially labeled USS NEW MEXICO as she plunged down greased ways on April 23, 1917. Sponsor at the elegant launching ceremonies was Miss Margaret C de Baca, daughter of New Mexico\u2019s Governor Ezequiel Cabeza de Baca. For Miss C de Baca and for the state of New Mexico (the first time a U.S. Navy ship had been named NEW MEXICO), it was a red letter day.\n\nWar-built battleship NEW MEXICO constituted at that time the prime example of engineering prowess, of U.S. naval architectural know-how. Rising ominously from the NEW MEXICO\u2019s deck in a 2-A-2 gun arrangement were four massive steel turrets, each built up entirely of flat armor plates and housing a trio of 14-inch rifles. Most of the 5-inch guns in her secondary battery were spotted strategically in drier positions at upper deck level. Submerged below the waterline were two 21-inch torpedo tubes. Two popular-like cage masts adorned the 624-foot hull (16 feet longer than any previous BB class). Improved compartmentation and the substitution of a graceful clipper bow with bulbous forefoot for the ram bow of earlier capital ships were outstanding features.\n\nHowever, top innovation of all came when the NEW MEXICO was singled out to be the first turboelectric-driven battleship. Prompted by the successful record of the fleet collier JUPITER, pioneer in electric propulsion, Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels put his official O.K. on an order to outfit the NEW MEXICO with four mammoth General Electric motors. They would operate the NEW MEXICO\u2019s four propellers and enable her to make her accredited 21 knots.\n\nOld time sailors and engineers were quick to voice strong opposition in letters, telegrams and interviews, and soon had the controversy before the House Naval Committee. \u201cIt is bound to prove an expensive failure,\u201d argued the protesting experts, \u201cso let some other nation try it first.\u201d The decision of the Committee put the decision squarely up to Secretary Daniels.&quot;\n\nMore at: <a href=\"http://www.ussnewmexico.net/bb40-history/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ussnewmexico.net/bb40-history/</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-8643404648-72157633495052966", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8643404648/#comment72157633495115812", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1368549970", "_content": "See also <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8643404448/\" title=\"Laying Keel of U.S.S. \"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8260/8643404448_3409925b5e_m.jpg\" width=\"164\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Laying Keel of U.S.S. \" /></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8643404548/\" title=\"Adm.
