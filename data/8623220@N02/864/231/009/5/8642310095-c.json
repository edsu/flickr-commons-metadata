The poses the players assume for the photographer set a standard for baseball players for decades. The players often look like the rough-and-tumble lot that they were in that era. Finally, it is interesting to look at the background in some of the images to see the atmosphere of the ballpark and the features of the park itself. So pleased that you added this set!", "authorname": "William Sagle", "id": "8602872-8642310095-72157638366698413", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "8642310095"}}
