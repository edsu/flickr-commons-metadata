Basic stuff and they can't even get that right.

It's lovely that other Flickr users have been so great about providing more info, but I've tried finding info on old photos, and it can be very time consuming. The LOC often uploads many, many photos in a day, and this number would be considerably fewer if they researched each photo as they uploaded it. I would also love to see more info along with each photo; I'm just guessing that the amount of photos makes it difficult.

It was written by the chief of the Prints &amp; Photographs Division.  Additionally, please see our webpage of frequently asked questions about the Flickr project in general: <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/flickr_pilot_faq.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/rr/print/flickr_pilot_faq.html</a>\n\nIn 2004-06, the Prints &amp; Photographs Division was delighted to receive enough funding to scan all 40,000 glass negatives in the Bain Collection. (See <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/ggbain/digitizing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/ggbain/digitizing.html</a>.) The funding also had limits, and we had to find an expeditious way to provide basic captions. Rather than decipher and transcribe the handwritten titles and dates directly from the glass plates (very time consuming and thus costly), we relied on a typed set of caption cards that Library staff had made some decades ago by looking at the Bain company\u2019s handwritten index cards as well as notes on the paper sleeves that housed the negatives. \n\nThe information on the Bain caption cards and sleeves was not always identical to the info on the negatives, but it was usually quite close. We tried to be explicit about the \u201cincomplete\u201d aspects of the titles by putting a note in each record to indicate the preliminary nature of the information: &quot;Title from unverified data provided by the Bain News Service on the negatives or caption cards.&quot;\n\nHaving the digital images go online was a foundation step that made future projects possible. People could now more easily compare the titles on the negatives and the information from the caption cards by enlarging the photo image to see the letters on the negative clearly. Then, flesh out abbreviations, correct misspellings, and add subject information. That\u2019s where the Flickr project has made such an important contribution\u2013the reconciliation and verification of data is now well underway! Some 9,000 Bain photos are in Flickr, which means far better captions for almost 25% of the collection already.", "authorname": "Ryan (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-8642310663-72157633270243752", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8642310663/#comment72157633273021640", "realname": "dullshick", "path_alias": "dullshick", "author": "25945306@N03", "iconserver": "8256", "datecreate": "1366256236", "_content": "The magic of the Internet! \nThank you LOC for posting great images to Flickr.", "authorname": "dullshick", "id": "8602872-8642310663-72157633273021640", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8642310663/#comment72157633305382819", "realname": "James Arboghast", "path_alias": "arboghast", "author": "23476577@N07", "iconserver": "2309", "datecreate": "1366690029", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryan_loc] Glad to hear all that.
