Henriette Caillaux was a murderer, and the wife of the Finance Minister of France.  Her husband's reputation was sullied by the editor of Le Figaro, who had printed the private correspondence of the minister, parts of which suggested improprieties while in office.  In defense of her husband, Mme. Caillaux went to the editor's office, pulled out a pistol, and shot him three times in the chest, killing him instantly.  Her trial was big news in the year 1914.  Remarkably, she was acquitted on the basis that the murder was not premeditated but an overwhelming emotional response which she (being a woman) could not have controlled.\n# <a href=\"URL\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Henriette_Caillaux</a>", "authorname": "billy_pilgrim", "id": "8602872-5083439797-72157625045516279", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5083439797/#comment72157625171475618", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1287179385", "_content": "This link works better:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henriette_Caillaux\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henriette_Caillaux</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-5083439797-72157625171475618", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "5083439797"}}
