To ensure this did not happen, in 1911 a law was passed recognizing his bastard daughter, Charlotte, as Louis's acknowledged heir, and making her part of the sovereign family. This law was later held to be invalid under the 1882 statutes. Thus another law was passed in 1918 modifying the statutes to allow the adoption of an heir, with succession rights. Charlotte was formally adopted by Louis in 1919, and became Charlotte Louise Juliette Grimaldi, Princess of Monaco, and Duchess of Valentinois.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte,_Duchess_of_Valentinois\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte,_Duchess_of_Vale...</a>", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-5084032648-72157625046289165", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5084032648/#comment72157625171678142", "realname": "Roger", "path_alias": null, "author": "49015875@N00", "iconserver": "162", "datecreate": "1287182042", "_content": "wikipedia thinks its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Heine\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Heine</a>", "authorname": "victuallers2", "id": "8602872-5084032648-72157625171678142", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5084032648/#comment72157625046972015", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "29079609@N02", "iconserver": "5491", "datecreate": "1287182610", "_content": "interesting, if you think this woman is 52-58 years old it could be, since we know this photo is 1910-1915)  It's hard to say if that is gray hair, I don't think she looks old enough to be that age.

It does, indeed, appear that this is a photo of Alice Heine taken much earlier.  An article in McClure's Magazine (May 1924), p. 57, includes a front-facing portrait of her from later in her life, and the features seem to match.  Other biographical details I gathered along the way from this article and one in Town &amp; Country (Feb. 8, 1913): She was the daughter of New Orleans banker Michael Heine.  She married Armand de Jumilhac at age 16 and became the duchesse de Richelieu two years later when he inherited the title.  She was a widow with two children by age 24, and she married Prince Albert of Monaco in 1889.  They divorced in 1902, and because of a prenuptial agreement she sacrificed a large part of her fortune to her husband when they parted ways.\n\nWe'll add some information to the description when we next update to identify her and indicate that the portrait was likely from an earlier photograph.", "authorname": "Barbara (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-5084032648-72157625541749762", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5084032648"}}
