A reversed half-tone negative is then pressed against this light-sensitive coating and an exposure in daylight made (taking from 10\u201330 minutes in summer, to several hours in winter). The bitumen hardens and becomes resistant to normal solvents in proportion to the light. The coating is then washed in turpentine solutions, removing the unhardened bitumen. It is then retouched in the tonal scale of the chosen color to strengthen or soften the tones as required. Each tint needs a separate stone bearing the appropriate retouched image, and prints are usually produced by at least six, and more commonly from 10 to 15 tint stones.[4]&quot;", "authorname": "Vagabond Jewelry (Kest)", "id": "8602872-3751632199-72157621683388725", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3751632199/#comment72157625755949606", "realname": "", "path_alias": "spangleann", "author": "14142328@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1294258435", "_content": "Thanks for adding this to the group.\n\nLovely old photo - fascinating bridge.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.chainbridgehotel.com/Restoration_of_the_Chain_Bridge\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.chainbridgehotel.com/Restoration_of_the_Chain_Bridge</a>", "authorname": "1945Ann", "id": "8602872-3751632199-72157625755949606", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3751632199/#comment72157633510836446", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pixelwrangler", "author": "43854658@N00", "iconserver": "5533", "datecreate": "1368722964", "_content": "The <b>Chain Bridge Hotel</b> is uniquely situated on a narrow strip of land between the dramatic fast-flowing waters of the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisbell50000/7591383596/\">River Dee</a> on one side, and the serene <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/_winsome/488498317/\">Llangollen Canal</a> on the other.  Access to the hotel is via a long, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/16248284@N03/5977298762/\">narrow drive</a>. Berwyn Station with its famous <a href=\"http://www.llangollen-railway.co.uk/page.php?id=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">steam trains</a> is located across the river from the hotel.\n\nThe chain bridge, from which the hotel takes its name, was originally constructed in 1814 by Exuperious Pickering, a local owner of coal mines and lime kilns, to enable him to take his coal across the river for delivery to Corwen and Bala while avoiding three toll fees over the Llangollen Town Bridge. \n\nThe original bridge hung from a network of handmade chains, and became the most famous and unique bridge on the river. It was refurbished and strengthened in 1870, rebuilt in 1876, and rebuilt again in 1929. \n\nThe bridge has been closed due to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanfrombangor/5081635163/\">safety reasons</a> for the past 30 years, however a recent grant from the <a href=\"http://www.hlf.org.uk/aboutus/decisionmakers/committees/Documents/WalScheduleMarch.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heritage Lottery Fund</a> will allow a thorough evaluation of the bridge, and determine the cost to restore it (if further funding is available).\n\nThe original <b>Chain Bridge Inn</b> was most likely built around the same time as the bridge (c.1814). In the 1870s the Inn was rebuilt and enlarged in the black and white style that can be seen today.\n\nThe Tudor Bar is situated in the main, 1870, building, and has black and white beams, with an Inglenook fireplace.\n\nWilliam Watson (1873-1961), the Liverpool-born champion cylist, racing driver and motoring pioneer, was also interested in hotels, and briefly owned the Chain Bridge Hotel around 1960.\n\nSeamus O'Keeffe and his wife Elizabeth, bought the hotel in 2012 for \u00a3500,000, and have pledged to fully restore the hotel by the Bicentennial of the hotel in 2014.\n<i>&mdash;Compiled</i> [<a href=\"http://www.chainbridgehotel.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a> [<a href=\"http://llanblogger.blogspot.com/2012/10/new-owners-vision-for-chainbridge-hotel.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.rhyljournal.co.uk/news/113295/-500-000-price-tag-as-ex-stephanie-hotel-sold.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-east-wales-18190768\" rel=\"nofollow\">4</a>] [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Watson_(motoring_pioneer)#cite_ref-19\" rel=\"nofollow\">5</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.peoplescollectionwales.co.uk/(X(1)A(V5sf9LG0zAEkAAAAMTgyMTUyNjUtMDdiYS00MGI2LThmY2EtMjBlN2MwODdlNzZlqLwdep07mXTrBwHb98cz4strAis1))/Item/45816-the-chain-bridge-and-hotel\" rel=\"nofollow\">6</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.llangollen.org.uk/history/the-chain-bridge\" rel=\"nofollow\">7</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.pentredwr.co.uk/lcc/newslet/nov07.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">8</a>] [<a href=\"http://online-bookings.touristnetuk.com/hotel/gb/chainbridgehotel.html?aid=311272\" rel=\"nofollow\">9</a>]\n\n&nbsp;\n<b>Chain Bridge Hotel &ndash; Then and Now</b> (100+ years later)\n\nAt some point a major three-story addition was made, significantly increasing the length of the hotel along the river-front.
