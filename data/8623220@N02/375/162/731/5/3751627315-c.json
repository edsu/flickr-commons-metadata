A reversed half-tone negative is then pressed against this light-sensitive coating and an exposure in daylight made (taking from 10\u201330 minutes in summer, to several hours in winter). The bitumen hardens and becomes resistant to normal solvents in proportion to the light. The coating is then washed in turpentine solutions, removing the unhardened bitumen. It is then retouched in the tonal scale of the chosen color to strengthen or soften the tones as required. Each tint needs a separate stone bearing the appropriate retouched image, and prints are usually produced by at least six, and more commonly from 10 to 15 tint stones.[4]&quot;", "authorname": "Vagabond Jewelry (Kest)", "id": "8602872-3751627315-72157621807763650", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3751627315/#comment72157632933782036", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1362587678", "_content": "From <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyl\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyl</a>\n&quot;A Rhyl landmark was the Pavilion Theatre, an ornate building with five domes, which was demolished in 1973 and the adjacent pier which was finally removed in 1972.&quot;\n\nBut the five-domed building in a 1913 photo at\n<a href=\"http://www.francisfrith.com/rhyl/photos/the-beach-and-the-pier-1913_65731/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.francisfrith.com/rhyl/photos/the-beach-and-the-pier-1...</a>\nhas a different exterior.\n\nThe building in the photochrom is shown in an 1892 picture\n<a href=\"http://www.francisfrith.com/rhyl/photos/the-pier-1892_30367/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.francisfrith.com/rhyl/photos/the-pier-1892_30367/</a>", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-3751627315-72157632933782036", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3751627315/#comment72157632929799239", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1362588087", "_content": "See photos with estimated date of 1880 from the UK National Media Museum.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/8513012741/\" title=\"'Rhyl, The New Pier' by National Media Museum, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8513012741_3d5cf6c42c_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"168\" alt=\"'Rhyl, The New Pier'\" /></a>\nand\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalmediamuseum/8513049573/\" title=\"'Rhyl, View From The Pier' by National Media Museum, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8245/8513049573_efc524fd95_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"169\" alt=\"'Rhyl, View From The Pier'\" /></a>\n\nThese show no large pavilion building.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-3751627315-72157632929799239", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3751627315/#comment72157633491241499", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pixelwrangler", "author": "43854658@N00", "iconserver": "5533", "datecreate": "1368677681", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/23103743@N05] <b>swang</b> said, <i>&quot;But the five-domed building in a 1913 photo ... has a different exterior.&quot;</i>\n\nThat's because the Grand Pavilion, (first) built in 1891, was wiped out in a spectacular fire on September 14th, 1901.[<a href=\"http://rhyl-life.blogspot.com/2010/04/grand-jubilee-organ.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>] &nbsp;The Pavilion was rebuilt in 1907, and opened on July 30, 1908.[<a href=\"http://rhyl-life.blogspot.com/2010/03/safe-house.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>]\n\nThat dates this LOC Photochrom to 'earlier than Sept 14, 1901'.
