A reversed half-tone negative is then pressed against this light-sensitive coating and an exposure in daylight made (taking from 10\u201330 minutes in summer, to several hours in winter). The bitumen hardens and becomes resistant to normal solvents in proportion to the light. The coating is then washed in turpentine solutions, removing the unhardened bitumen. It is then retouched in the tonal scale of the chosen color to strengthen or soften the tones as required. Each tint needs a separate stone bearing the appropriate retouched image, and prints are usually produced by at least six, and more commonly from 10 to 15 tint stones.[4]&quot;", "authorname": "Vagabond Jewelry (Kest)", "id": "8602872-3751629225-72157621807787508", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3751629225/#comment72157621818397888", "realname": "Chris Samuel", "path_alias": "chrissamuel", "author": "94482242@N00", "iconserver": "3346", "datecreate": "1248507939", "_content": "The paddle steamer leaving Penarth pier is almost certainly one of P&amp;A Campbell's &quot;White Funnel Fleet&quot; which did trips around the Bristol Channel.\n\nOne of their vessels, the Waverley, still does day trips in the summer from the pier.", "authorname": "Chris_Samuel", "id": "8602872-3751629225-72157621818397888", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3751629225/#comment72157621766194035", "realname": "", "path_alias": "gales_photo", "author": "56118141@N00", "iconserver": "8539", "datecreate": "1248945288", "_content": "An amazing photo, I was here just a short while ago, really great to see this, I'll show it to my son, he will love it....", "authorname": "Gale's Photographs", "id": "8602872-3751629225-72157621766194035", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3751629225/#comment72157621766462699", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jinbkk", "author": "19815888@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1248948955", "_content": "Have you noticed that the buildings at shore end of the pier have not been constructed?\n\nHere it is today from Tripadvisor:\n<a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotos-g609086-Penarth_Vale_of_Glamorgan_Southern_Wales_Wales.html#19312991\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotos-g609086-Penarth_Vale_o...</a>", "authorname": "johninbkk", "id": "8602872-3751629225-72157621766462699", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3751629225/#comment72157622104761152", "realname": "Susan Williams", "path_alias": "susan_w", "author": "43671228@N00", "iconserver": "130", "datecreate": "1250888776", "_content": "This is it, built about 1894?\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/susan_w/3827199365/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3525/3827199365_a928e605c8_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"Penarth Pier \" /></a>", "authorname": "bookish in north park", "id": "8602872-3751629225-72157622104761152", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3751629225/#comment72157621984712945", "realname": "Chris Samuel", "path_alias": "chrissamuel", "author": "94482242@N00", "iconserver": "3346", "datecreate": "1250941521", "_content": "According to the <a href=\"http://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/enjoying/visit_the_vale/attractions/historic/penarth_pier.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vale of Glamorgan council website</a> the pavilion was built in 1907.", "authorname": "Chris_Samuel", "id": "8602872-3751629225-72157621984712945", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3751629225/#comment72157635061056252", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66311327@N05", "iconserver": "7333", "datecreate": "1376421405", "_content": "<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Penarth,+Wales&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.434086,-3.168054&amp;spn=0.002649,0.016512&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=rcs&amp;hnear=Penarth,+Vale+of+Glamorgan,+Vereinigtes+K%C3%B6nigreich&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=51.434086,-3.168054&amp;panoid=H-Xm4regMCUQuHqRbKowvA&amp;cbp=11,39.83,,0,-3.92\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com/maps?q=Penarth,+Wales&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=...</a>", "authorname": "B-59", "id": "8602872-3751629225-72157635061056252", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "3751629225"}}
