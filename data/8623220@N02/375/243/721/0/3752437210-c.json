A reversed half-tone negative is then pressed against this light-sensitive coating and an exposure in daylight made (taking from 10\u201330 minutes in summer, to several hours in winter). The bitumen hardens and becomes resistant to normal solvents in proportion to the light. The coating is then washed in turpentine solutions, removing the unhardened bitumen. It is then retouched in the tonal scale of the chosen color to strengthen or soften the tones as required. Each tint needs a separate stone bearing the appropriate retouched image, and prints are usually produced by at least six, and more commonly from 10 to 15 tint stones.[4]&quot;", "authorname": "Vagabond Jewelry (Kest)", "id": "8602872-3752437210-72157621683532307", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3752437210/#comment72157621851373537", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1249695256", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnarvon_Castle\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnarvon_Castle</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-3752437210-72157621851373537", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3752437210/#comment72157621922252623", "realname": "Maria", "path_alias": null, "author": "81669806@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1250360477", "_content": "From a true Coffi (someone who was born in the Town of Caernarfon) take a look at <a href=\"http://www.caernarfononline.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.caernarfononline.com</a> and see the town today and all that is going there from the quey side now to the music of the towns talent like singer songwriter Sarah Lousie who's great great grandfather was the ferry master that took people and catle across the meani straits, and whos great grandmother was the towns pianist, from the silent movies to the monthly balls. and whos grandmother was born within the towns walls.
