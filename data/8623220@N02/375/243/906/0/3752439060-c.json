A reversed half-tone negative is then pressed against this light-sensitive coating and an exposure in daylight made (taking from 10\u201330 minutes in summer, to several hours in winter). The bitumen hardens and becomes resistant to normal solvents in proportion to the light. The coating is then washed in turpentine solutions, removing the unhardened bitumen. It is then retouched in the tonal scale of the chosen color to strengthen or soften the tones as required. Each tint needs a separate stone bearing the appropriate retouched image, and prints are usually produced by at least six, and more commonly from 10 to 15 tint stones.[4]&quot;", "authorname": "Vagabond Jewelry (Kest)", "id": "8602872-3752439060-72157621807988656", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3752439060/#comment72157621891466904", "realname": "", "path_alias": "igamogam", "author": "21672649@N00", "iconserver": "4069", "datecreate": "1248955268", "_content": "Are these scans of the postcars retouched in any way? the qualiy seems superb but the colours smack of having been worked on in Photoshop - they seem to be very vivid for 100 year old prints.

So you are saying these postcards are photographic prints with multiple litho spot-colour tints applied afterwards? It must have been murder inking, hefting, registeringa and printing multiple stones, probably hundreds, possibly thousands of times for each run of images (I mean - lots were printed to make money no?...) \n\nWhat I can't understand is how the images are so vivid after nearly 120 years. They must have been stored in an light/air-tight environment for the last 90 years to look so good, either that, or they have been tweaked for saturation after scanning.\n\nIt's great that these prints are being digitised, though it's odd to see the Library of Congeress doing it when the images are of a little country which is part of a small island on the other side of the Atlantic (speaking as a Welshman...).", "authorname": "igamogam", "id": "8602872-3752439060-72157621898491652", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3752439060/#comment72157621902678518", "realname": "Kest Schwartzman", "path_alias": "vagabondjewelry", "author": "22334021@N03", "iconserver": "2297", "datecreate": "1249036893", "_content": "Based on the time they were printed, one would assume oil based inks- which will keep their colour for a very very long time- just as long as oil based paints, in fact.
