F.M. Passow (LOC)\" /></a>\nA biographical sketch from 1902:\n&quot;Captain F. M. Passow, of the American line steamship St. Louis, entered the service of the Inman line as a British subject twenty-five years ago. When the Inman line came under the control of the International Navigation Company, and the Government Subsidy Act required that all commanders of the American line should be American citizens, Captain Passow adopted this country as his legal residence. He has been in charge of the St. Louis for three years. He was the chief officer of the City of Paris, now the Philadelphia, on her eventful trip from Southampton, in March 1890, when an explosion of the starboard engine threatened to sink the vessel, with her passengers and crew of more than one thousand, off the Irish coast. Passow, with six men, put to sea in a lifeboat to seek assistance. After nearly three days and nights spent in the search, they returned to the City of Paris, which was later towed to Queenstown in a sinking condition. Captain Passow was the navigating officer of the Harvard, with the rank of commander, during the Spanish-American War.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/masters-of-the-sea.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/masters-of-the-sea.html</a>\nHe retired from the American line at the end of 1915:\n<a href=\"http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70912FE39591A7A93CAA8178DD85F428185F9\" rel=\"nofollow\">select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70912FE39591A7A...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-7267738884-72157629906496330", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7267738884"}}
