The title was later used by lancer regiments in the Russian, Prussian, and Austrian armies.\nUhlans typically wore a double-breasted jacket (kurta) with a coloured panel (plastron) at the front, a coloured sash, and a square-topped Polish lancer cap (czapka) also spelt 'chapka,' chapska and schapska. This cap or cavalry helmet was derived from a traditional design of Polish cap, made more formal and stylised for military use.\nTheir lances usually had small, swallow-tailed flags (known as the lance pennon) just below the spearhead.", "authorname": "Cassies grandma", "id": "8602872-7267732058-72157629904178636", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "7267732058"}}
