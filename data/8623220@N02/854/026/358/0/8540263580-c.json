Schwab's Bethlehem Steel. [Schwab and his wife both have pictures in this batch.] The Austrian ambassador had been asked to leave and this piece suggested that Bernstorff might suffer the same fate and that other staff of the German embassy certainly would.  The article mentions that both the Austrian ambassador, Dumba and Schwab were at the St. Regis hotel, that Dumba and Bernstorff had dined at the Ritz-Carlton recently, and Bernstorff visited Dumba at the St. Regis.  Clearly journalists were staked out outside the hotels.  Presumably this picture was taken at some point during this affair.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-8540263580-72157632951212787", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "8540263580"}}
