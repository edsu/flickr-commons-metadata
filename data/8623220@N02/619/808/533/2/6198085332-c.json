Engineering officer with extensive colonial experience; a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Galli\u00e9ni.  Appointed chief of the General Staff over better-known colleagues, 1911; strongly encouraged the offensive doctrine that was in vogue at the time.  In Aug.1914, his initial refusal to admit the failure of his opening offensives and to grasp the strength of the German invasion nearly cost France the war at the very outset, but in the crisis of the Long Retreat Joffre\u2019s strengths emerged: he remained imperturbable, kept a tight grip on his armies, and struck back hard when an opportunity appeared.  His victory at the Marne was incomplete - the Germans were stopped, but not broken - but it was enough to give the authoritarian Joffre the prestige to assume almost dictatorial powers for a time.  His 1915 offensives were bloody failures, the German attack on Verdun in 1916 revealed serious deficiencies, and in Dec.1916, he was effectively removed from power by being kicked upstairs to ceremonial and figurehead roles.  Joffre was purposeful, very strong-willed, and profoundly self-confident - but he was also stubborn, autocratic, and imperceptive.  In the first weeks of the war, it can be said that he saved France, after putting France in the position of needing to be saved. &quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-6198085332-72157627697049409", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "6198085332"}}
