Before the war he was a highly influential instructor and administrator at the \u00c9cole de Guerre who promoted the \u2018offensive spirit\u2019 doctrine that would become French military dogma by 1914, but he also more sensibly encouraged flexibility and adaptability.  Though he\u2019d never been in combat before, he successfully endured desperate fighting in Lorraine in Aug.1914 and in the Battle of the Marne in Sep.  Commanded Army Group North, Jan.1915-Dec.1916.  After a brief hiatus, became Chief of Staff to P\u00e9tain in May.1917;  organized Allied relief to Italy, fall 1917; named Allied Supreme Commander in spring 1918, though with limited powers. Credited as the mastermind behind the successful Allied offensives in the last months of the war.  Foch favored a tough settlement with Germany, and predicted a second world war when one was not imposed.  Intelligent, resolute, cool, and supremely aggressive.  One of the most remarkable personalities of WWI. &quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-6198088058-72157627821211218", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "6198088058"}}
