Long and very distinguished career as a colonial soldier; declined the offer of command of the French Army due to ill health, in favor of Joffre, 1911.  Energetically organized Paris\u2019s defenses in the crisis of Aug-Sep 1914 and played a key role in French planning for the First Battle of the Marne.  As War Minister, Oct.1915-Mar.1916, he clashed with Joffre but was forced to resign due to illness, dying soon afterwards.  Resourceful, dynamic, and acute; one of France\u2019s most able generals. &quot;", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-6198085164-72157627697042349", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "6198085164"}}
