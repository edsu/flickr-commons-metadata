Sierichs to see if they would agree to have photographic portraits made by &quot;leading photographers&quot; for exhibition at the St. Louis World's Fair.  Bain seemed to be behind the plan.  The piece suggests that the exhibit for portraits of men was not accepted by the Fair organizers.  I have not yet managed to confirm whether the exhibit of women's portraits materialized.  Since Sierichs (or Bain) paid for the portraits that were taken, it would certainly make sense that he claimed the copyright.  I hypothesize that this picture of Edith Rockefeller McCormick was taken as part of this program.  There appears to be a photographer's signature followed by Chicago at lower right.\n\nLoC has at least one more portrait copyrighted by Sierichs in 1904, of Miss F.A.
