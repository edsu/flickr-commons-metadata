In 1876, she left Albion to attend Boston Theological Seminary. Upon graduation, in 1878, as the only woman in her class, she took charge of a church in East Dennis, Massachusetts, but the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church refused her application for ordination because she was a woman. It also took steps to revoke her preaching license. Finally, in 1880, Shaw convinced the Methodist Protestant Church to grant her ordination so she could administer the sacraments and continue her ministry in East Dennis.\n\nIn addition to ministering at two churches, Shaw earned a medical degree from Boston University in 1886. However, she never practiced medicine.&quot;\n\nSource:\n<a href=\"http://www.greatwomen.org/women.php?action=viewone&amp;id=141\">Anna Howard Shaw</a> -- National Women's Hall of Fame", "authorname": "Elizabeth Thomsen", "id": "8602872-2595542338-72157605720112510", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2595542338/#comment72157605721490556", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jack44", "author": "78895344@N00", "iconserver": "3813", "datecreate": "1214004914", "_content": "She looks strong.
