I agree that the man on the right looks like Champ Clark. However, I think that Vice President Thomas R. Marshall is the man seated next to Champ Clark. Take a look at another image of Marshall from the Bain News Service: <a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/service/pnp/ggbain/07700/07701v.jpg\">memory.loc.gov/service/pnp/ggbain/07700/07701v.jpg</a> for comparison.
