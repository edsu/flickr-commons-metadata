Headed by Colonel Joseph H. Pendleton, the regiment was originally intended for duty in Mexico as part of an expeditionary brigade.  \nInstead, it was sent to Guantanamo Bay and held in readiness for emergency duties, while undergoing intensive training.  On 1 May, this unit was redesignated 2d Regiment, Expeditionary Force, USMC.  As such, it remained in Cuba until the latter part of the month, when it boarded the PRAIRIE for the United States, arriving at Philadelphia on 1 June, when it was \ndissolved.&quot;</blockquote>\nIt seems a reasonable surmise that the Marines in these photos, and those who were the subject of the Times article, might have been this regiment.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-2594699159-72157605728601781", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2594699159/#comment72157605796585245", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11572312@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1214331400", "_content": "actually, the NYTimes article is there, you need to scroll down to see the first part.", "authorname": "Harry Angstrom", "id": "8602872-2594699159-72157605796585245", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2594699159/#comment72157605793576438", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1214337031", "_content": "Cotinis, whyaduck, and Harry Angstrom: Thanks for your comments and information.
