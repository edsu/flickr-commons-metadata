It lies on the sloping side of a low moutain on the south side of Bethlehem Pennsylvania.  This was the side of the town where the mill stood.  It was the side that the workers lived on as you can see by the row homes in the picture.  As the plant closed and the jobs disappeared many families were forced to leave.  Shops and lunch counters closed with no noon rush to keep them open.  The south side became run down, buildings sat empty and this cemetery was neglected and vandalized.  \n\nBehind where Evans stood to shoot this image, the graves continue up into the tree line.  Many do not contain a word of English, baring testament to the various ethnic groups that had come here to work at the steel.  Some, such as a plain cross cut from sheet metal show just how hard some people were struggling.", "authorname": "Shadows And Rust", "id": "8602872-3549661708-72157626338919199", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3549661708/#comment72157627031009778", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "64425565@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1308856968", "_content": "I have always been intrigued and saddened by the downfall of Bethlehem Steel and all it symbolized in this great nation.

I did a short narration so that my children could see and understand the blood, sweat, and tears that built this country.
