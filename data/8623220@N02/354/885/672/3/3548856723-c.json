I was working at the American Folklife Center at the Library at the time, and I wrote back-of-the-print notes for about a half dozen of the selected photographs.  In the course of doing this (as best I recall), I ran into Jack Delano (the photographer for this image) and followed up with an exchange of letters.  He confirmed the yarn that we had all heard about the photo: &quot;You told the man his pants were falling down.&quot;  Here is the note I wrote that accompanied the print-for-sale in the 1980s:\n\nThis photograph is part of a group of pictures made in Connecticut between 1937 and 1941 by Farm Security Administration photographers Jack Delano, John Collier, Russell Lee, Edwin Locke, and Marion Post Wolcott.  Evidently the agency had offered some agricultural support programs in the region.  The photographers' captions suggest that they were sent to portray three overlapping groups: part-time farmers, ethnic farmers, and tobacco farmers.  The caption for this photograph, made in a community north of Hartford, reads &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Lyman, Polish tobacco farmer and FSA client.&quot; \n\nThe picture shows a high degree of camera consciousness on the part of the subjects, and can be seen as a collaboration between photographer Jack Delano and the Lymans.  The Lymans seem to have assumed the customary pose for a snapshot: standing side by side and facing the camera.  Delano, however, does not shoot them head on, but shoots from a low angle to one side.  And unlike a snapshot's eye contact and smile, this picture has been made at a moment of high laughter and diverted gaze.  Delano explains that he made the couple laugh by telling Mr. Lyman that his pants were falling down.  &quot;The thought of such a catastrophe,&quot; Delano writes, &quot;apparently made them break up.&quot; \n\nJack Delano studied art at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and subsequently became interested in photography.  He worked for the FSA and the Office of War Information until 1943, finishing his stint with an assignment to Puerto Rico.  He fell in love with the island, returning first on a Guggenheim photographic fellowship and later serving as director of Puerto Rico's radio and television operation.", "authorname": "Carl_205", "id": "8602872-3548856723-72157620866030300", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3548856723/#comment72157620875145206", "realname": "", "path_alias": "toots", "author": "61849735@N00", "iconserver": "79", "datecreate": "1246576370", "_content": "What a wonderful story.
