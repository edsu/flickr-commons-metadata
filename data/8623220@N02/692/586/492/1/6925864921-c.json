On each pigeon's leg was a narrow strip of tissue paper bearing the message: &quot;Universal peace soon will be a god-send&quot;. The message was signed by Colonel Lee Crandall.\n\nAfter their arrival in Washington, the pigeons were released the following day at 9:15AM, and almost all of them had arrived in New York City later that day.
