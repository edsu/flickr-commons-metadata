More than 500 people were turned away from the packed courtroom.\n\nAfter a twelve day trial the jury deliberated for one hour and forty-five minutes before returning a verdict of not guilty, after three ballots. Judge William H. Williams presided.\n\nEight months after the trial, Helen remarried her former husband, Frank Angle, a foreman at Union Metallic Cartridge Company in Stamford. It was said that during her trial Mr Angle's sympathies were aroused, and he was a frequent visitor in the court.\n[<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F70613FE3E5A15738DDDAE0994DB405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>]  [<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F6091EFE3E5A15738DDDA90A94DB405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>] [<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F20612FF355C13738DDDA10A94D8415B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a>]\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-6927524874-72157629444297512", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6927524874/#comment72157629775604880", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jon_loc", "author": "63860770@N07", "iconserver": "2794", "datecreate": "1337289138", "_content": "Thanks for the interesting story Pixel Wrangler.
