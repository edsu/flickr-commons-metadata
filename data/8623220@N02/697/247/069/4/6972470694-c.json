I make a wish when- \never I see two white horses. I had great luck on the \nnight before the finals of the National Champion- \nships at Philadelphia. I was talking with Mrs. \nWightman, whom I was to play, when I saw a falling \nstar. There is nothing so lucky as wishing on a fall- \ning star. I made my wish, &quot;I want to win the \nNational.&quot; And I did. \nThen, I have a Japanese brooch which I always \nwear when I play; it is so ugly that I cannot wear it \nat any other time. I am afraid to play without \nit. &quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://www.archive.org/stream/tennisforwomen00bjurrich/tennisforwomen00bjurrich_djvu.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.archive.org/stream/tennisforwomen00bjurrich/tennisfor...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6972470694-72157629580232738", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6972470694/#comment72157631007963790", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1344636600", "_content": "pennylrichardsca and artolog:\n\nThank you for the information!
