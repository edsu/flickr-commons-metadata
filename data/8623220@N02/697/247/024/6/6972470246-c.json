We can add some information when we next update the description.  \n\nGood question about photography during trial proceedings.  I don't know the precise answer, although Emma Little, who published an article about Bain many years ago had a colorful account of how one of the office boys Bain trained to take pictures got the first photos of a trial in a New York federal court, where photographers were banned on pain of contempt of court.  The boy &quot;got a step-ladder and placed it in front of the court-room door, put his camera through the high transom and let the flash light, leaped down and dashed off with his camera, leaving the step-ladder to block the door.&quot;  (Emma Little, &quot;The Father of News Photography: George Grantham Bain,&quot; <i>Picturescope</i> 20 (1972): 203.)
