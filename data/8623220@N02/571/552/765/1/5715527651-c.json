She didn't attend school until the age of ten, after teaching herself how to read and write at age 10. After only a few months she dropped out because she wasn't being intellectually challenged and the lack of support from her parents. At age 15 Ella took the certification examination to become a teacher and passed but was told she was too young to be a teacher.
