In 1893, Hinman, who had come to Binghamton in 1889, went to work as a clerk for a lawyer named George F. Lyon. Later that same year, Lyon took on another law clerk, Archibald Howard, just out of Lafayette College. In 1894, Thomas B. Kattell went with Lyon as a law clerk. In 1901-1902, the three joined together to form Hinman, Howard &amp; Kattell, an upstate New York law firm that continues under the same name today.", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-5715533379-72157626711392346", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "5715533379"}}
