I searched the Illustrated London News and this photo was published there on February 12, 1916 (p. 213). The caption with it says: \n\nWhere a Lady Addressing a Religious Meeting was Killed: A Wrecked Mission Hall - Showing The Hole Made by the Bomb\n-Further typical effects of the recent Zeppelin raid are here seen. If it were not for the suffering caused to innocent non-combatants, these results, in view of the German boasts, might be described as ludicrous. As regards the scene of the lower photograph [the one depicted in this Bain photo], a &quot;Times&quot; correspondent wrote: &quot;A woman missionary, the wife of a well-known vicar, was standing, Bible in hand, addressing an audience of about 200 persons, mostly women and girls, when a bomb dropped between the church and mission room. A hole was left in the ground about 4 feet deep and 12 feet in diameter within 20 fee of the mission room. The woman missionary was struck by a huge fragment of shell and killed instantly. Another lady and a young girl were also killed on the spot.&quot;", "authorname": "Jon (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-10995218655-72157638862650826", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "10995218655"}}
