Thaw, a civilian pilot who crash-landed his plane in Central Park on March 6, 1916 after running out of gas during a trip from Hempstead, Long Island to Governor's Island.

I'm guessing this photo was taken after the wings and propeller were removed so the plane could be towed away.\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B06E0D8103FE233A25754C0A9659C946796D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B06E0D8103FE2...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-10995440243-72157637945104966", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/10995440243/#comment72157638387880125", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jon_loc", "author": "63860770@N07", "iconserver": "2794", "datecreate": "1386274872", "_content": "Thanks for the additional information and correction artolog.
