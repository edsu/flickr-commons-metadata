Had all ten been fired, as was supposed to be possible, there was also the detrimental effects of the blast on the ships superstructure to take into account.......the likelihood and effects of blast damage to superstructure also effectively prevented the wing turrets from firing directly ahead or astern too, again reducing potential fire power in either direction.\n  It seems strange to note that, despite the handicaps imposed by these turret arrangements, which must have been glaringly obvious to many senior naval officers and ship designers of the day, the layout was repeated in the next class of battleship, the Colossus class, ordered and laid down the same year!", "authorname": "umbry101", "id": "8602872-5853174234-72157626902758671", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5853174234/#comment72157627030697846", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jon_loc", "author": "63860770@N07", "iconserver": "2794", "datecreate": "1308853962", "_content": "Very interesting.

This cumbersome arrangement was also a feature of the later, similar Colossus class, but it was discontinued after these ships because there was a very real fear that if the structures took damage from incoming fire, they could collapse and obstruct or damage or jam the gun turrets underneath them. The whole layout of wing turrets and flying bridges was ill-conceived and badly thought out, and was never repeated(thankfully). the Colossus class also incorporated another retrograde step in capital ship design, by having the mainmast stepped abaft the fore funnel. With a head wind, or at high speed, this meant the spotting top on the mainmast was rendered completely unusable and uninhabitable, due to the heat and smoke and exhaust gases from the forward funnel which enveloped it.", "authorname": "umbry101", "id": "8602872-5853174234-72157626907182677", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5853174234/#comment72157627032047008", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "29079609@N02", "iconserver": "5491", "datecreate": "1308866714", "_content": "it was a difficult time being a ship designer, new classes came out almost yearly between 1909 and the end of the war.  Superfiring/centerline guns were just being designed even as the guns themselves were being made larger and heavier.

For example, as we have seen, the Neptune and Colossus classes did not have a broadside of all ten 12&quot; guns, the gun layout precluded this and eight was the maximum actually possible. Their maximum armour belt thickness was actually less than that of HMS Dreadnought herself, built five years earlier!  Needless to say, this fact was NOT made public knowledge!  At the same time, the scanty armour protection of the latest battlecruisers was deliberately and greatly exaggerated, so that on paper, at least, the RN was a  vastly superior force in all respects to any and all of its potential enemies.  The only thing that mattered, it seems, with the benefit of hindsight, was numbers,  bigger ships with bigger guns. British capital ships of this period were not faulty, or ineffective, but their true fighting value was somewhat disguised by arithmetical inaccuracy, and this was only exposed to public scrutiny under the rigours of war, and as we all know, the catalogue of battleship and battlecruiser losses between 1914-18 brought this into very sharp focus.........", "authorname": "umbry101", "id": "8602872-5853174234-72157627035140224", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5853174234"}}
