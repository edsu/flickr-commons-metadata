Art Fletcher was definitely a New York Giant, so we'll make sure the caption is corrected to reflect that.\n\nrjones0856:\n\nI do think Hub Perdue has some resemblance to the unidentified player, but I don't think it's a match.  Here are <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=hub+perdue&amp;st=gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">other images of Perdue</a> from our holdings. His ears stick out quite a bit, and the unidentified player does not share that characteristic.  \n\nYour suggestion made me curious if I could find a match for the unidentified player, however.  I reviewed the roster of the St. Louis Cardinals for 1914, since we can see that from his uniform that he's a Cardinal, and checked for portraits of players in our collections.  Working my way through the roster, I found photographs of nearly every player  and I think I found a match for the unidentified player in outfielder Lee Magee.  <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/ggbain.11712/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This photograph of Magee</a> as well as these <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=lee+magee&amp;st=gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">others</a> show a lot of good matching facial characteristics.   \n\nThanks to all for the close looking, as always!", "authorname": "Kristi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-5853171202-72157628129119392", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5853171202/#comment72157628004519277", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1321310958", "_content": "Yeah, that really looks like Magee.", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-5853171202-72157628004519277", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5853171202/#comment72157628133993904", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "91829349@N00", "iconserver": "5466", "datecreate": "1321368400", "_content": "I'll buy that.
