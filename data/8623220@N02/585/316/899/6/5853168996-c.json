The municipality comprises the city of Mechelen proper, some quarters at its outskirts, the hamlets of Nekkerspoel (adjacent) and Battel (a few kilometers away), as well as the villages of Walem, Heffen, Leest, Hombeek, and Muizen. The Dijle flows through the city, hence the term 'Dijlestad' (&quot;City on the river Dijle&quot;). Mechelen lies on the major urban and industrial axis Brussels-Antwerp, about 25 km from each city.\n\nThis seems to be the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?ss=2&amp;w=all&amp;q=schepenhuis+mechelen&amp;m=text\" rel=\"nofollow\">Schepenhuis</a>.", "authorname": "trialsanderrors", "id": "8602872-5853168996-72157626889258703", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5853168996/#comment72157627029950818", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jon_loc", "author": "63860770@N07", "iconserver": "2794", "datecreate": "1308846936", "_content": "trialsanderrors, thanks for providing the alternate spelling.
