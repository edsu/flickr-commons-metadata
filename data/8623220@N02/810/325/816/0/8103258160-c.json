He shared the perils of Pancho Villa's army for four months, present with Villa's Constitutional(must say Constitutonalist) Army (under Venustiano Carranza who was its &quot;First or Principal Chief&quot; as he was known) when it defeated Federal forces at Torre\u00f3n, opening the way for its advance on Mexico City.  Reed's time with the Villistas resulted in a series of outstanding magazine articles that brought Jack a national reputation as a war correspondent. Reed deeply sympathized with the plight of the peons and vehemently opposed American intervention, which came shortly after he left. Jack adored Villa, while Carranza left him cold. Jack's Mexican reports were later republished in book form as Insurgent Mexico, which appeared in 1914.\nIn\n<a href=\"http://www.nevadaobserver.com/Mexican Revolution - People/Pancho Villa and John Reed.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nevadaobserver.com/Mexican%20Revolution%20-%20People/...</a>\nBack to back with the driver, wearing his mounted police Stetson\nand\n<a href=\"http://www.nevadaobserver.com/Mexican Revolution - People/Pancho Villa_ John Reed and Toribio Ortega.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nevadaobserver.com/Mexican%20Revolution%20-%20People/...</a>\nyou can see Pancho Villa and &quot;Juanito&quot; Reed (as Pancho rebaptized him).", "authorname": "jerodamor@yahoo.com.mx", "id": "8602872-8103258160-72157631813938274", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103258160/#comment72157631815805126", "realname": "", "path_alias": "melystu", "author": "92033577@N00", "iconserver": "7439", "datecreate": "1350781891", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/11418107@N02] Thanks!

He also protested for the syndicalist Union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). \n\nHe wrote for a left-wing magazine called &quot;The Masses&quot; and, with his journalist wife, Louise Bryant, witnessed first-hand both phases of the Revolution. John Reed and Louise Bryant witnessed first-hand the October Revolution, in which the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (bolshevik) headed by Vladimir Lenin toppled the Kerensky government in what they believed to be the first blow struck in a worldwide socialist revolution. Reed produced the incredible chronicle about this, <i>Ten Days that Shook the World</i>.\n\nUpon returning the the U.S. at the behest of the Comintern, to consolidate Communists in America, his notes and journals were seized by the government and he and Bryant were subjected to routine harassment, searches of their home and surveillance. Reed felt that there was a need for him to represent his new splinter group of the Socialist Party of America, the American Communist Party to the new Bolshevik government and left the U.S. secretly. \n\nBryant  and Reed were also forced to testify before the U.S. Senate about their &quot;Communist sympathies&quot; and even their religious beliefs. Upon hearing that the Finns had held Reed in jail after his attempt to return home (Russia was under blockade), Bryant left under cover and made it to Russia to join her husband. While on a reluctant trip to Baku in the near East, to promote the new Bolshevik government as a &quot;Holy War&quot;, Reed heard that Bryant had arrived in Moscow and he rushed back to join her. \n\nReed was determined to return home, but fell ill on September 25. At first thought to have influenza, he was hospitalized five days later and was found to have spotted typhus. Bryant spent all her time with him, but there were no medicines to be obtained because of the Allied blockade. His mind started to wander, and then he lost the use of the right side of his body and could no longer speak. His wife was holding his hand when he died in Moscow on October 17, 1920, aged 32. After a hero's funeral, his body was buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.", "authorname": "GregHausM.D.", "id": "8602872-8103258160-72157631928750464", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103258160/#comment72157631956121075", "realname": "", "path_alias": "vercettisworld", "author": "14343849@N05", "iconserver": "8323", "datecreate": "1352334166", "_content": "To inspire anyone who doesn't &quot;get&quot; Reed's passion, Here's a link to the Internationale, the song of the workers of the world: \n\n<a href=\"http://youtu.be/kDwZAtE6yWY\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/kDwZAtE6yWY</a> (German) \n\nThe &quot;original&quot; or most popular, with Lenin in May Day parades: \n\n<a href=\"http://youtu.be/GvXBNnpHFDI\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/GvXBNnpHFDI</a>\n\nOr even better, the Russian version:\n\n&quot;\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b&quot; &quot;Internatsional&quot; (The Internationale)", "authorname": "GregHausM.D.", "id": "8602872-8103258160-72157631956121075", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103258160/#comment72157631957460337", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1352345329", "_content": "Mabel Dodge, one of Reed's lovers, described him in a way that makes this portrait come to life:\n&quot;His olive green eyes glowed softly, his high forehead was like a baby's with light brown curls rolling away from it and two spots of shining light on his temples, making him lovable.
