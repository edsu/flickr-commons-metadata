In the meantime, the ship was named after the newest state in the union The New York Times estimated that 75,000 people attended the launch, including John Purroy Mitchel, the Mayor of New York City, George W. P. Hunt, the governor of Arizona, and many high-ranking military officials. Several warships were also nearby, including many of the new dreadnoughts which had already entered service (Florida, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas, New York, and Texas). Esther Ross, the daughter of an Arizona pioneer family, was given the honors of ship sponsor and christening.
