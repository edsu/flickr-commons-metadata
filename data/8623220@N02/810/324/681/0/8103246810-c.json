In the meantime, the ship was named after the newest state in the union The New York Times estimated that 75,000 people attended the launch, including John Purroy Mitchel, the Mayor of New York City, George W. P. Hunt, the governor of Arizona, and many high-ranking military officials. Several warships were also nearby, including many of the new dreadnoughts which had already entered service (Florida, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas, New York, and Texas). Esther Ross, the daughter of an Arizona pioneer family, was given the honors of ship sponsor and christening. To acknowledge a ban on alcohol recently passed by the state legislature, the state's governor decided that two bottles would be used: one full of sparkling wine from Ohio, and another filled with water from the Roosevelt Dam.", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-8103246810-72157631808455422", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103246810/#comment72157631846520225", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1351119772", "_content": "William Jennings Bryan and wife in New York City on June 19, en route to the USS ARIZONA launching:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103233445/in/photostream/]\nSecretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, with commodores and admirals, at the launch:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103233259/in/photostream/]\nThe ceremony:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103246604/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103232857/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103246128/in/photostream/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103231881/in/photostream/]\nSPLASH!:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103245462/in/photostream/]\nGovernor Hunt of Arizona looks happy:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103245356/in/photostream/]\nOkay, it didn't sink -- what do we do next?\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103245260/in/photostream/]\nEsther Ross, descendant of Arizona pioneers, christened the ship:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103231303/in/photostream/]\nHere is a formal portrait of  Esther Ross, taken before the ceremony:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103241766/in/photostream/]\n&quot;Look -- We didn't even get wet!&quot;\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103245012/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-8103246810-72157631846520225", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8103246810/#comment72157631858830864", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1351274170", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Arizona_(BB-39)\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Arizona_(BB-39)</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-8103246810-72157631858830864", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "8103246810"}}
