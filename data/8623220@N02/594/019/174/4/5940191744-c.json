Some time ago it was discovered to be a German product, sold by a German firm.  Now its depots are in ruins.&quot;\n\nFrom another contemporary diary, dated August 2, 1914:\n&quot;All the syndicalist unions are nearly depleted and have obeyed the mobilization order. Tremendous enthusiasm was shown everywhere. Big crowds of Russians, Italians, English, students and sympathizers, are parading Paris day and night. One mob of at least 20,000. stretching all the way from the Opera to St. Denis, paraded with flags, singing in turn their national hymns. The scene at night almost beggars description. The mobs were almost insanity personified.\nToday all the Bon Laitre Maggi stores (the milk stores of the Maggi Company) were completely destroyed all over the city. The fixtures were taken away by the crowds, comprised mostly of women, and used for firewood. This company is organized by German-Swiss capital.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=O1JIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;dq=paris+maggi+1914&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BBL7xUwcgt&amp;sig=-hdyUgFhN2PetxzMXbD2mPnAq3g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BdTATtfgMZSPigKgo4GVAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=paris maggi 1914&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=O1JIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA278&amp;l...</a>\n\nFrom Andre Gide's diary:\n&quot;On returning to the rue du Dragon, I witness the sacking of a \nMaggi dairy store. I get there a bit late; the shop is already empty; \ntwo big fellows, with a sort of tacit approval on the part of the police, \nare just finishing breaking the shop windows with a kind of wooden \nrake. One of them has climbed onto the show-case; he is holding up a \nbig, brown, earthenware coffee-pot, which he exhibits to the crowd \nand then throws onto the sidewalk, where it crashes noisily. There is \nmuch applause.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.archive.org/stream/journalsofandreg031199mbp/journalsofandreg031199mbp_djvu.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.archive.org/stream/journalsofandreg031199mbp/journals...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-5940191744-72157627999130379", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5940191744/#comment72157627999167377", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1321256604", "_content": "Cropped from original Agence Meurisse photo at Bibliotheque Nationale de France's Gallica site, with following caption:\n&quot;Les \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9s de la tension : le laboratoire Maggi rue Condorcet &quot;\n[    ???   :the Maggi laboratory Rue Condorcet]\n<a href=\"http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9041274q\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n<img src=\"http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9041274q/f1.highres\" width=\"240\" height=\"173\" alt=\"Les \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9s de la tension : le laboratoire Maggi rue Condorcet \" /></a>\n\nPub.
