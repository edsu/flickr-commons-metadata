It's a good suggestion that this unidentified man could be Theodore Roosevelt based on the location and his general appearance, but the date of the photograph doesn't support it, unfortunately.

(Pinkey was a nickname for Frances Benjamin Johnston.)  While this particular image is not part of Pinkey's Blue Book, you can see that the <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/ppmsc.04897/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cover image</a> was taken at the same time, and the book is dated to 1888 by the writing just below it.  \nTheodore Roosevelt was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1897 by President McKinley.
