Corley of Dallas, Texas, born  21 January 1884. Lost both hands and his right arm in a railroad accident in 1905.  He invented the hook for his arm, patented 1912, with which he could drive his automobile, including crank starting it. With various other prosthesis of his own invention, he was reported able to write with pencil, pen, or typewriter. \n\nThis photo was published (cropped) on page 540 of &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot; volume 88, 1916 with the caption &quot;Judge Corley can run his automobile alone, and does it because he likes to.&quot;\n\nThe Quentin D.
