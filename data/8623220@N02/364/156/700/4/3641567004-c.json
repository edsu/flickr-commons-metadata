He had no royal aspirations; instead he turned to study science, geography, geology, botany, ethnology, and anthropology. He focused on the documentation of physical characteristics, in particular the shape and dimension of the skull as a way to established relations between the human races. He perceived photography as a scientific tool for preserving data from his expeditions, and used it to document the American Indians, Surinamese, Hottentots, and other ethnic groups. Bonaparte was president of the &quot;Socie\u0301te\u0301 de ge\u0301ographie&quot; (France) from 1910 till his death, and was also a member, then president, of the &quot;Acade\u0301mie des sciences&quot; (France).&quot;\n\nHe may have been in the news in summer 1913 because, according to \n  <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B03E6D71F3AE633A25754C0A9609C946296D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B03E6D71F3AE633A...</a>\nhe was a host of a banquet in Paris for Admiral Peary.", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-3641567004-72157622196257320", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3641567004"}}
