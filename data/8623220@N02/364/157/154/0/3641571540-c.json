He developed many of the fundamentals of the game that are second nature today. As a player and manager he developed many of the strategies of the game still in use, such as the \u2018squeeze-bunt\u2019 and the \u2018hit-and-run\u2019. John McGraw asked that the pitchers and catchers report first to spring training, weeks ahead of other players, as they always seem to be the most \u2018out-of-shape.\u2019 and when once asked about a substitute hitter in a game, he described the man as \u201cgood in the pinch,\u201d leading to use of the term \u2018pinch-hitter.\u2019 His New York Giants teams won 10 National League pennants, 3 World Series, and finished second 11 times. His record for most wins as a National League manager still stands at 2,669 victories. He was an incredible judge of baseball talent, and his player development program made the Giants perennial contenders. Health issues forced John McGraw into retirement mid-way through the 1932 season, yet he was able to manage the National League team in the first-ever All-Star Game in 1933.", "authorname": "mr.thalweg", "id": "8602872-3641571540-72157626071995065", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3641571540"}}
