This is confirmed in the New York Times, Novemeber 22 1913 page 1, which describes the sudden death of Marble.  The date of his appointment to the commission was March 10, 1913.\n\nPossibly this photo is from soon after March 10, when Marble and Clark were appointed to the commission.\n\nIncidentally, on page 9 of the August 14, 1915 New York Times, it is described that Marble replaced Franklin Knight Lane when he became Secretary of the Interior, and Marble was succeeded by Silas W. Smith after death.  Neither of these men are photographed, strengthening the case for March 10 to November 20 1913 as the date.  Marble had served as attorney and secretary for the commission before being appointed as commissioner, so this extra step seems important.", "authorname": "Rob Ketcherside", "id": "8602872-3239317542-72157613481970135", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3239317542/#comment72157613511570822", "realname": "Rob Ketcherside", "path_alias": "tigerzombie", "author": "29056926@N02", "iconserver": "3136", "datecreate": "1234114518", "_content": "My suspicion is confirmed in the bottom left of the photo: very faintly written is &quot;3/15/13&quot;.
