Although Taft was defeated by Democrat Woodrow Wilson, it was a partial success to Nellie Taft: her ambition as Election Day neared was to see Roosevelt defeated. The day before she left the White House, Nellie Taft's genuine view on suffrage made itself known: she ascended to a prominent place on a grandstand to review a parade of suffragists and encourage their demand of the incoming president to support a woman's right to vote.&quot;\n\nHere's another photo by Bain of the same group:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2515738807/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-3239318874-72157624830259786", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3239318874"}}
