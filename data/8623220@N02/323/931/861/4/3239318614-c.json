Her first husband, Harry Bramhall Gilbert, died in 1911 and she remarried in January 1914.\n\nSee NYT from October 7, 1913.\nMRS. GILBERT WILL WED CAPT. DUGMORE; Widow of H.

Dugmore, who represented Britain at the 1908 Olympics in the triple jump.  See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Dugmore\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Dugmore</a>.  The string of names &quot;Cyril Patrick William Francis Radclyffe&quot; matches, but the birth dates don't.
