From 1897 (when she was 60) she was known as Mother Jones and in 1902 she was called &quot;the most dangerous woman in America&quot; for her success in organizing mine workers and their families against the mine owners. In 1903, upset about the lax enforcement of the child labour laws in the Pennsylvania mines and silk mills, she organized a Children's March from Philadelphia to the home of then president Theodore Roosevelt in New York. The magazine Mother Jones , established in 1970, is named after her. In the 1989-90 Pittston Coal strike the wives and daughters of the miners organised themselves as the &quot;Daughters of Mother Jones&quot; and represented the strikers to the press.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Harris_Jones\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Harris_Jones</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-5375076635-72157625885166412", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "5375076635"}}
