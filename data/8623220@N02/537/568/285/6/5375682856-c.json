In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, Deakin was a major contributor to the establishment of liberal reforms in the colony of Victoria, including the protection of rights at work. He also played a major part in establishing irrigation in Australia. It is likely that he could have been Premier of Victoria, but he chose to devote his energy to federation.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Deakin\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Deakin</a>", "authorname": "manfire", "id": "8602872-5375682856-72157625749758497", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5375682856/#comment72157625896701084", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anne_loc", "author": "35014516@N03", "iconserver": "3087", "datecreate": "1295887244", "_content": "manfire: Thanks for the additional info. on Deakin.
