His main findings, though disputed already in the 1920s, were not finally rejected until the late 1990s. Whether his misleading findings were based on fraud or simply the result of a lack of scientific rigor remains unclear. Abderhalden's drying pistol, used in chemistry, was first described by one of his students in a textbook Abderhalden edited.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Abderhalden\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Abderhalden</a>", "authorname": "manfire", "id": "8602872-5375682990-72157625749744457", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "5375682990"}}
