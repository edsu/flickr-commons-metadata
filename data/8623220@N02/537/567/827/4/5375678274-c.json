This act placed the two countries at the brink of war, creating a considerable amount of international tension.  Agentina, Brazil and Chile offered to mediate the dispute and their offer was accepted by the Mexican and American governments. Niagara Falls was selected as the location for the peace conference, with the meetings taking place at the Clifton House Hotel, now the  site of Oakes Garden Theatre.  The talks began on May 20. After about a month, an agreement was reached that averted a war between Mexico and the United States.  However, Mexico's internal strife continued.
