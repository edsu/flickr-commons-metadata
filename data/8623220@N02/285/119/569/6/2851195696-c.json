He was a New York attorney who served three terms in the House of Representatives. \n\nJ.M. Levy had (after many complications) acquired Monticello from the estate of his uncle, U.S. Naval Commodore Uriah Phillips Levy, who had bought it in 1836. A brief history of the Levys' work to preserve Monticello can be read on <a href=\"http://www.monticello.org/jefferson/dayinlife/wishes/profile.html\">this page</a> at Monticello.org.
