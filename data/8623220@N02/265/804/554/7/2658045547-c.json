A couple of web sites mention a Joe Turner who held the Police Gazette Gold Belt  as middleweight wrestling champion. <a href=\"http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/022198/nef_m2foley_.html\">This 1998 article</a> by Bill Foley of the Florida Times-Union tells of Turner defending  his title in a January 19, 1920 bout in Jacksonville. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.victoriansecrets.net/hines.html\">This page</a> about an historic row house on 14th Street in Washington D.C. says (in the penultimate full paragraph) that Joe Turner's funeral was held in the Hines Funeral Home in that building, and that he had operated the Kit-Mar Restaurant and Arena nearby. The page also claims a link to his obituary, but the link's destination has apparently been altered since the page was last updated and only reaches a spammy site.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.legacyofwrestling.com/Graveyard_R-Z.html\">This Wrestling Graveyard page</a> gives the date of his death as February 18, 1947, and says he is buried at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Washington. Someone with access to Washington newspaper archives might check them to see if his obituary can confirm that this was the same Joe Turner in the Bain photo. It probably was.\n\nI'm wondering if the belt Turner wears in this photo is the Police Gazette Gold Belt? The magazine handed out many belts for many sports, but I've been unable to find pictures of any of them through Internet image searches.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-2658045547-72157606373284135", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "2658045547"}}
