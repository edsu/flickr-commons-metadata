View to house from orange and yellow garden.\n\nIn Gardens for a Beautiful America (p. 304) Sam Watters describes the house this way: &quot;The artist Albert Herter was an heir to the Herter Brothers furniture fortune. With his wife Adele McGinnis, also an artist and heir, he built a pink stucco villa overlooking a pond flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean. When asked why his house and garden were reminiscent of Sicily, Albert Herter answered, &quot;It is perhaps the sea; and I am sure our three Sicilian workmen are also responsible.&quot; The house had color-themed gardens: a blue and white terrace, and this orange-and-yellow court with continuous bloom; tulips and crocus in April, climbing yellow roses in May and June, followed by yellow phlox and orange-yellow Sweet William, dahlias, trumpet vine, and zinnias. A gray fog softened the floral brilliance when Johnston photographed the house in the early fall. She considered it to have the 'loveliest and most consistently developed waterside garden I know in this country.'&quot;\n\nFor more pictures related to Herter (in costume, later in life, and his artwork and WWI posters), see the Prints &amp; Photographs Online Catalog, <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=Albert+herter&amp;sp=1&amp;st=gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=Albert+herter&amp;sp=1&amp;amp...</a>\n\n--Helena (LOC)", "authorname": "The Library of Congress", "id": "8602872-10345386946-72157636723153886", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "10345386946"}}
