He argued that scientific theories should be held as mere &quot;working hypotheses.&quot; To &quot;possess weight&quot; a working hypothesis must receive the assent of all, or nearly all, who are capable of investigating the subject. By the time of the publication of Evolution or creation, the consensus of scientists was hardening against Darwinism in any form. Seizing the opportunity, Townsend applied the rule. Darwin's hypothesis should have no weight except that accorded to other very questionable speculations.'", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-10345579383-72157636705995543", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/10345579383/#comment72157637098087044", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1383078813", "_content": "Thank you for your research swanq.
