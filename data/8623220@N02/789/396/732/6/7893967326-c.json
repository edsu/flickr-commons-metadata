At the one hand it gives you a feel of what it looked like way back: the clothes are distinct.  \nAt the other it is a testament of something we don't like.\nThe stance of the boy is interesting. You can almost see him thinking; ok let's stand here so this guy can do his interesting stuff. The photographer might even have paid him for his time(which would be irony). He is smoking, so it might be that the boy took this moment to light one up. Why not?\nAs such it is just a shot. The double nature comes from the background. It is child labor; in our view this kid is exploited:  he should be at school.\nThe photo has a double nature  because the kid earns money this way and it seems like the photo was made to more or less expose kid labor so it can be abolished.. so in fact the picture is actually aimed at losing this kids job. I wonder if boy would have helped out if the photographer had told him: i am going to take a picture  so we can use it to stop you from working.\nThis is the double edge of child labor. There was an documentary of an asian girl, perhaps eight years old, who made carpets. Child labor. She and her whole family worked,(slaved might be a better description).. only together they could get enough money to buy the basic needs. Abolish child labor and that income falls away and the family has to struggle harder.  \nAnother double nature: The kid doesn't look exploited in the picture. He seems almost relaxed and in good spirits..  But actually in the end it would probably have been better if he had attended school.\nI wonder what happened to him.. maybe he became a great sportsman with all his cycling experience?\n You'll never know.\nA very capturing picture..", "authorname": "Taubchen", "id": "8602872-7893967326-72157631364650536", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7893967326/#comment72157631368420108", "realname": "Michael Neubert", "path_alias": "neubert_lacy", "author": "25068151@N02", "iconserver": "3737", "datecreate": "1346600351", "_content": "The reference to &quot;Red Light&quot; dangers has to do with working (at least some of the time) in an area (known as a &quot;red light district&quot;) where prostitution was common and one would hope not to find children at all, much less working.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-light_district\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-light_district</a>\n\nSuch references are common in this child labor related collection - see\n<a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=red%20light&amp;co=nclc\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=red%20light&amp;co=nclc</a>", "authorname": "Michael  Neubert", "id": "8602872-7893967326-72157631368420108", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7893967326/#comment72157631382046916", "realname": "Fabiano  Bulow", "path_alias": "fabianobulow", "author": "77169190@N06", "iconserver": "7452", "datecreate": "1346667537", "_content": "garoto com estilo!", "authorname": "Fabiano Bulow", "id": "8602872-7893967326-72157631382046916", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7893967326/#comment72157631384510894", "realname": "Barbara", "path_alias": "barbara_loc", "author": "33593953@N02", "iconserver": "3267", "datecreate": "1346680759", "_content": "Michael Neubert: Thanks for the helpful explanations about bicycles and the &quot;Red Light dangers&quot; reference.
