Here for example is nothing more than kids scrounging the dump for metal and tin etc to be taken to centers that paid them for it.  I can't tell you the hours me and my buddies in the 40s and 50s spent scowering the town dump for bottles that could be returned for money.  Money that was ours to keep and spend as we wished.  We brought our bb guns with us and shot at the rats and all in all had thoroughly enjoyable times.", "authorname": "jack byrnes hill", "id": "8602872-7893969284-72157631350480286", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7893969284/#comment72157631355692528", "realname": "annet", "path_alias": "mezze", "author": "98338006@N00", "iconserver": "5", "datecreate": "1346530788", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/jackbyrneshill] \nwho bought food for you?", "authorname": "mezze", "id": "8602872-7893969284-72157631355692528", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7893969284/#comment72157631359562994", "realname": "Timothy Cahill", "path_alias": null, "author": "54763979@N08", "iconserver": "5259", "datecreate": "1346551150", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/jackbyrneshill] Hey Jack, there's a little over 5,000 images on the LOC website.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?sp=1&amp;co=nclc&amp;st=gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?sp=1&amp;co=nclc&amp;st=gallery</a>\n\nThe image below might be more along the lines of what you're looking for.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ncl2004000031/PP/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ncl2004000031/PP/</a>\n\nI think if Lewis Hine wanted to only take pictures of destitute children exploited by industry he most likely could have.  He also has a lot of portraits of adults in industry that don't show a hint of exploitation, and I think that's because he wanted to show the spirit these people had in spite of the bad working conditions, because he cared about them.", "authorname": "TimEC", "id": "8602872-7893969284-72157631359562994", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7893969284/#comment72157631364896462", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "65589481@N05", "iconserver": "8466", "datecreate": "1346584686", "_content": "Well   done.    nice   image.", "authorname": "kristavanichinnsamy", "id": "8602872-7893969284-72157631364896462", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "7893969284"}}
