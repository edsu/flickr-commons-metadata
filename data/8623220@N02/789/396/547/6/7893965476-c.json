Second thing i thought of was all the boys that no longer deliver newspapers.  I grew up delivering newpapers in the 40s and 50s.  Nothing prepares you better for the real world of work than delivering newspapers.  Up at 4am, jump on the bike (which must be kept in good working order), go to the pickup spot, get your bundles, break them open and fold them and stack them into your basket.  then head out (winter and summer) to deliver.  cold empty streets, unshoveled sidewalks and steps, etc.  then on saturdays going around and collecting money and keeping the books.  All great preparation.  Do any kids deliver newspapers anymore.  I know they don't around here.", "authorname": "jack byrnes hill", "id": "8602872-7893965476-72157631350546626", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7893965476/#comment72157631361706896", "realname": "mary", "path_alias": null, "author": "42614915@N00", "iconserver": "12", "datecreate": "1346564749", "_content": "@pennylrichardsca : That was the first thing I noticed.", "authorname": "marymactavish", "id": "8602872-7893965476-72157631361706896", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "7893965476"}}
