Even if these employees made it through the work week, they were forced to pay money to the company store for food and supplies and pay rent to the company for the privilege of living in a company owned shack. These shacks were horrendous and certainly not worth the amount of money that they paid.  \n__________________________________________________________________\nHow many children worked at the turn of the 20th century? The 1900 U.S. Census surveyed 2 million children working in a variety of occupations including agriculture, factory work and mining. This census did not produce accurate numbers, however. The reason was, is there were many segments of child employees that were not considered and counted as working. Four prolific groups form the numbers that were not counted: 1.) Children that worked after school were not counted; no matter how many hours a child went to school or worked after school hours they were not counted. Many children went to school only a few hours a day and then worked 12 hours. Due to the disqualification they were not counted.  2.) Children working in agriculture; 3.) Children under the age of 10 were not counted as working.  There were a large number of very small children, even under the age of five that worked in agriculture as pickers; working in canning factories counted as working in agriculture (represented by the oyster shucker photo of 'Manuel&quot;; in mines such as &quot;Vance&quot; in the above picture or as a breaker boy; 3.) in factories, particularly textile factories. Children were often used in textile factories because they could easily get around moving machinery. \n\nHundreds, if not thousands of children were killed and maimed in the course of working. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 eliminated most forms of child labor. There are and have been loopholes in agriculture to which children have been working to include positions on commercial farms. These farms hire &quot;families&quot; to work, and even young children can be included in this agreement. \n\nSadly, there are have been some calls by politicians withing in the last couple of years to repeal child labor laws.", "authorname": "theresapye", "id": "8602872-7893951646-72157631753816358", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7893951646/#comment72157631754121538", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1350071772", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/71958988@N04] \nI'm not sure which part of that she didn't understand.", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-7893951646-72157631754121538", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7893951646/#comment72157631756351652", "realname": "", "path_alias": "embeesweb", "author": "28853714@N05", "iconserver": "8270", "datecreate": "1350100467", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/artolog] Thank you, artolog.  :)  Maybe somebody needs new glasses or has been sitting in front of her monitor for too long...", "authorname": "EmBee's Web (Limited Access)", "id": "8602872-7893951646-72157631756351652", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "7893951646"}}
