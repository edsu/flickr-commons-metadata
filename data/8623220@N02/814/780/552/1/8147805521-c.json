Until the 30's, there was a building on the west side of the lot, along Church Street, which was the Parish House.\nThat is the building in the back of the picture, and is also pictured here, in the lower right hand corner:\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jbqlV2qgDEA/TeZQd-i5unI/AAAAAAAAIvk/vhK_2nhtzks/s1600/vesey.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.bp.blogspot.com/-jbqlV2qgDEA/TeZQd-i5unI/AAAAAAAAIvk/vh...</a>\n\nSt.Paul's Chapel has been renovated a number of times.  From this picture, it looks like the rough brick walls on the building were covered in 1915 with stucco.  \nHere is the same wall more recently:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/emilio_guerra/7306339138/\">www.flickr.com/photos/emilio_guerra/7306339138/</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-8147805521-72157631929966674", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "8147805521"}}
