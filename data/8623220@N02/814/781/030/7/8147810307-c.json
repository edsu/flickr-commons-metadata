If this is the case, she is the daughter of James Lawrence Breese a partner in &quot;Breese &amp; Smith&quot; brokerage firm. (2)\n\nThere is some interesting information about her in the &quot;Weekend Utopia&quot; by Alastair Gordon (page 35).  You can read that section on books.google.com\n\nThere is a picture of her when graduated from high school at <a href=\"http://www.photoseed.com/blog/2012/08/16/dream-girls/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Photo Seed Blog</a>, if you are interested.\n\nI'm not sure why Bain took her photo.  However, if the date is between 1910-1915, I assume that this is her picture with her husband - Larry Miller - a stock broker.\n\n<i>References:</i>\n1.
