There is a Times article on 7/12/15 noting the arrival of the 18 year old (and slightly built) Viscount Uffington, 18 years old and on his way to join the Territorial Army in Bermuda. (maybe he's taking his own rifle with him?)  He stated that he was leaving New York in 5 days. He was the son of the 4th Earl and his American wife, Cornelia Martin.  He became the 5th Earl in 1921, which is probably when Bain changed the caption.\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E12F83B5C13738DDDAB0994DF405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E12F83B5C13738...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-8147842042-72157631919591536", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8147842042/#comment72157631959678916", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "88919847@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1352365064", "_content": "Lord ME ME ME.", "authorname": "jameseh2012", "id": "8602872-8147842042-72157631959678916", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8147842042/#comment72157631965053248", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "77603809@N02", "iconserver": "3758", "datecreate": "1352427471", "_content": "Handsome young chap, pity he died so young.", "authorname": "KenjiB_48", "id": "8602872-8147842042-72157631965053248", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8147842042/#comment72157631970430020", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1352498887", "_content": "Thanks for noting the error, B-59 and artolog.
