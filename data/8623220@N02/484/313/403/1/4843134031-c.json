However Bunk was unreliable, sometimes showing up drunk or not at all. After returning to New Orleans, his sidemen George Lewis and Jim Robinson blamed Bunk's lack of professionalism for spoiling their chance to make it into the &quot;big time&quot; up north. After Bunk's death they got another chance, and the band under leadership of clarinetist George Lewis became a very successful jazz group in the 1950s.\n\nBunk is shown with Maude Balque, generally known as Maude Johnson, although they were not actually legally married until 1949, less than 6 months before Bunk's death.", "authorname": "Infrogmation", "id": "8602872-4843134031-72157624621734638", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4843134031"}}
