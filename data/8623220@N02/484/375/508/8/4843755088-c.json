This advertising with a live band on a horse drawn bandwagon is no doubt a reference to it. The New Orleans bandwagons of 30- 50 years earlier would never have had a piano on them, just portable instruments. However since the band leader here was great jazz pianist Art Hodes, apparently an exception was made. Must have been some work getting the piano into the wagon.", "authorname": "Infrogmation", "id": "8602872-4843755088-72157624617273054", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4843755088/#comment72157624494072661", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "29079609@N02", "iconserver": "5491", "datecreate": "1280533261", "_content": "Possesed: US release: 7/26/47\n<a href=\"http://www.joancrawfordbest.com/filmspossessed47.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.joancrawfordbest.com/filmspossessed47.htm</a>", "authorname": "Kilted Cowboy", "id": "8602872-4843755088-72157624494072661", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "4843755088"}}
