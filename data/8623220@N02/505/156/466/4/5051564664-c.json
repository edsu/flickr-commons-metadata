This is after the outbreak of the WWI, Aug 1914, as her funnels have already been painted all black, and they were repainted  back to her original color again sometime in the fall. In 1915 when she was sunk it is generally believed they were still the original color. You can see she is high in the water, indicating this is the end of the trip as coal and supplies have been used up.  This photo is attributed to 1914 based on the visible modifications.
