The metal lifeboats were designed by Andreas P. Lundin of New York for the Welin Marine Equipment Company. Lundin filed at least nine patents for lifeboats and davits during the period 1908-1914.\n\nNot sure if these boats were part of the transatlantic honeymoon stunt. The NY Times refers to them as &quot;a thirty-six foot Lundin power lifeboat towing a twenty-eight foot Lundin decked lifeboat.&quot; \n\nThe newlyweds left New York on July 30th, 1914, with a crew of four, and made it as far as Boston. They were ordered back to Long Island on account of the war.
