Five or six hobos join in this. One builds a fire and rustles a can. Another has to procure meat; another potatoes; one fellow pledges himself to obtain bread, and still another has to furnish onions, salt and pepper. If a chicken can be stolen, so much the better. The whole outfit is placed in the can and boiled until it is done. If one of the men is successful in procuring 'Java,' an oyster can is used for a coffee tank, and this is also put on the fire to boil. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that California hobos always put a 'snipe' in their coffee, to give it that delicate amber color and to add to the aroma. 'Snipe' is hobo for the butt end of a cigar that smokers throw down in the streets. All hobos have large quantities of snipes in their pockets, for both chewing and smoking purposes. A 'beggar stew' is a 'mulligan,' without any meat.&quot;", "authorname": "bior", "id": "8602872-6771385169-72157629060079475", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6771385169/#comment72157629133845449", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1328130651", "_content": "Thanks bior for the tantalizing description of this delicacy.
