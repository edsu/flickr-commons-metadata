Located first in the old Providence Hospital at 4th Avenue and Madison Street (the present-day site of Seattle\u2019s federal courthouse), and later in a large building near the corner of Rainier and Dearborn Avenues, the Hotel de Gink was a bustling endeavor, lively and as novel as its name implies. \n\n\u201cGink\u201d was hobo slang meaning \u201cguy\u201d or \u201cfellow.\u201d The hobo history Knights of the Road recognizes the term as an appellation for fellow hoboes and defines it as a \u201cpoor unfortunate.&quot; The hotels were the brainchild of Jeff Davis, one of many to be proclaimed \u201cKing of the Hoboes.&quot; who organized the International Itinerant Workers (IIW), a short-lived labor union more popularly known as the \u201cHoboes of America.&quot; The IIW was a self-consciously patriotic response to the more politically radical Wobblies, or IWW \u2013 Industrial Workers of the World.&quot; \n<a href=\"http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=3849\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6771386125-72157629056131987", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6771386125/#comment72157629056231663", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1327685204", "_content": "Times account of grand opening of New York Hotel de Gink at Worth and Centre Streets, on 1/21/15, with this headline:\n&quot;HOTEL DE GINK OPENS IN A BLAZE OF GLORY; City Officials and Others, in Evening Dress, See 'King Jeff' Davis Ascend His Throne.
