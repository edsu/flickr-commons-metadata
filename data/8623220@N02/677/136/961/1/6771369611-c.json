Knowing how to run a company, which included putting his personnel in key positions, the Colonel wiped the front office clean. Ruppert installed Harry Sparrow as business manager, one of McGraw\u2019s oldest friends and a man that had arranged a Giants-White Sox world tour, and William Fleischman, who reportedly had introduced the Colonel to Johnson, was named secretary. &quot;\n\nNeeding a new field manager, the two owners immediately tabbed none other than Donovan, just months removed from claiming the International League\u2019s pennant. He was a man with an outstanding baseball reputation to teach and motivate, and also appeared to have the name and personality needed to guide the Yankees and compete with the Giants. \n<a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/pa/1927/hustonruppertbuyyankees.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.angelfire.com/pa/1927/hustonruppertbuyyankees.html</a>\n\n\nOne of 5 Bain Collection pictures  taken at the same time in connection with the sale and new management team of the New York Yankees in January, 1915:\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6771370761/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7008/6771370761_f72e452b5d_m.jpg\" width=\"165\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Bill Donovan (LOC)\" />\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6771370133/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7015/6771370133_1a6ec444d1_m.jpg\" width=\"165\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Bill Fleischman (LOC)\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6771371485/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7007/6771371485_6fb6d16ae5_m.jpg\" width=\"166\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Harry Sparrow (LOC)\" /></a>\n\n</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/6771370429/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7171/6771370429_a2c857ea56_m.jpg\" width=\"166\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Bill Donovan (LOC)\" /></a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6771369611-72157629086977489", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6771369611"}}
