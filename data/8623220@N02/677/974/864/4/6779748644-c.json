The Battle of the IJzer started in October 1914. Thanks to the water the Belgians could stop the Germans. At the end of October the Belgians had opened the gates of the Yser river and flooded the area. As a result, the river became a front line throughout the First World War. The city was first attacked on October 16, 1914 and defended by Belgian and French troops, which marked the beginning of the Battle of the Yser. Colonel Alphonse Jacques de Dixmude led the troops that prevent Diksmuide from being taken by the German Army. By the time the fighting ended, the town had been reduced to rubble. It was, however, completely rebuilt in the 1920s.&quot;\nSee also: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Yser\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Yser</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-6779748644-72157629444290693", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6779748644"}}
