On each pigeon's leg was a narrow strip of tissue paper bearing the message: &quot;Universal peace soon will be a god-send&quot;. The message was signed by Colonel Lee Crandall.\n\nAfter their arrival in Washington, the pigeons were released the following day at 9:15AM, and almost all of them had arrived in New York City later that day. Three of the pigeons, which belonged to Fred C. Schmidt (pictured above) arrived simultaneously at their loft in Brooklyn at 3:20PM.
