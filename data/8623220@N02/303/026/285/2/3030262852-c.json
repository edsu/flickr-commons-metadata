Most of them are clearly prisoner irons. The spiky one in the center would be attached to the end of a long pole and thrust against an escaping person's neck, trapping them between the arms which would spread to allow the person's neck in and then swing shut. Once the escapee's neck was trapped between the spiked ring, they had incentive to stop running. This was used by police officers on the mainland as well for centuries, although originally they were made of flexible wood or metal and without spikes.\n\nWhen I think of torture device, I think of something that was designed solely for the purpose of inflicting pain on people, whereas these devices are primarily for restraint.", "authorname": "Erik Harmon", "id": "8602872-3030262852-72157610686158448", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3030262852/#comment72157623370658554", "realname": "Sonya Bigboots", "path_alias": "sonyabigboots", "author": "45074338@N06", "iconserver": "2616", "datecreate": "1265551163", "_content": "Looks like my basement :)", "authorname": "Mistress Sonya Bigboots", "id": "8602872-3030262852-72157623370658554", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3030262852/#comment72157626460749858", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "90719112@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1302359465", "_content": "It should be noted that the ship 'Success' never transported convicts and these devices were never in use on board this vessel.
