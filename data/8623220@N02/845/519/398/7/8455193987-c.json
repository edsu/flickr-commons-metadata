They became social leaders in New York's high society. But in 1910 she brought a sensational divorce suit against her husband, claiming he beat her in drunken rages. She remarried in 1911, this time to Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt I, one of the wealthiest men in America having inherited the bulk of his father's fortune in 1889. They had two sons, Alfred Gwynne Jr. and George. Tragically, while traveling to England on business, Alfred Sr. heroically lost his life in the sinking of RMS Lusitania by torpedo in 1915. Margaret inherited her husband's fortune (as well as the bulk of her father's fortune when he died). One son from this marriage, Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt II went on to become one of the driving forces behind thoroughbred racing in America. Margaret married two more times, both ending in divorce. In 1931 she legally resumed her maiden name.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Isaac_Edward_Emerson\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Isaac_Edward_Emerson</a>\nMargaret Emerson's obituary from January, 1960:\n<a href=\"http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D06E4DD1138E333A25750C0A9679C946191D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D06E4DD1138E333...</a>\n\nA.G.
