My costume consists of two pieces, an upper garment and a bifurcated lower garment which I always designate by the name <i>harleys</i>.  The upper garment is always worn over the <i>harleys</i> and fitted at the shouders, falls in graceful and natural lines to a point between the hips and knees and does not define a waistline.  The <i>harleys</i> fitting easy around the waist and about the hips, slightly taper to the ankles, and cover each leg separately.  The corset is absolutely eliminated.  Ridges and rigidity would spoil the whole thing.&quot;", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-8455192161-72157632721068648", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "8455192161"}}
