This suggests second-line troops, but the standard field caps seem to rule out Landsturm which leaves either Landwehr or a reserve formation.\n\nI admit to the caption to the lower picture raising a smile - I doubt very much whether these men could haul that gun into position as it's set in a concrete emplacement! The Germans seem to be either infantrymen who have been pressed into service to help their Austrian comrades-in-arms or Bavarian artillerymen, since the only man wearing a pickelhaube has a spike rather than the artillery's ball (only Bavarian artillery wore spikes on their pickelhauben).", "authorname": "henrycrun", "id": "8602872-6332008438-72157628146194435", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "6332008438"}}
