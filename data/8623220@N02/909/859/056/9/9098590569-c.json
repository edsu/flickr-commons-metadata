Wellington Koo (29 January 1887 \u2013 14 November 1985), also known as Koo Vi Kyuin, Ku Wei-ch\u00fcn and Gu Weijun, was a prominent Chinese diplomat from the Republic of China. He was one of China's representatives at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919; served as an Ambassador to France, Great Britain and the United States; was a participant in the founding of the League of Nations and the United Nations; sat as a judge on the International Court of Justice in The Hague from 1957 to 1967. Between October 1926 and June 1927, while serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Koo briefly held the concurrent positions of acting Premier and interim President of the Republic of China. Koo is the first and only Chinese head of state known to use a Western name publicly.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_Koo\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_Koo</a>\n<a href=\"http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/v_k_wellington_koo.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/v...</a>\n\nThis is  the second of his (eventually) four wives:\n&quot;Koo's second wife, Tang Pao-yu &quot;May&quot; (simplified Chinese: \u5510\u5b9d\u73a5; traditional Chinese: \u5510\u5bf6\u73a5; pinyin: T\u00e1ng B\u01ceoyu\u00e8; c. 1895\u20131918), was the youngest daughter of the former Chinese prime minister Tang Shaoyi and a first cousin of the painter and actress Mai-Mai Sze. Their marriage took place soon after Koo's return to China in 1912. She died in an influenza epidemic in 1918. They had two children: a son, Teh-chang Koo (1916\u20131998, a.k.a. Wellington Koo, Jr.), and a daughter, Patricia Koo (b. 1918).&quot;\n\nThe picture appears to be from the same event pictured in a November 29, 1915 newspaper account of the arrival from Europe of Mr. and Mrs. Koo:\n&quot;Dr. V.
