After the Armistice, Mackensen was interned for a year. He retired from the army in 1920 and was made a Prussian state councillor in 1933 by Hermann G\u00f6ring. Mackensen, a nationalist rather than a National Socialist, frequently appeared at Nazi functions wearing his imperial cavalry uniform and became a major symbol of the integration of the Second and Third Reich.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_von_Mackensen\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_von_Mackensen</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-9098597811-72157634302688613", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9098597811/#comment72157634344453966", "realname": "Karen", "path_alias": "kchi_loc", "author": "34985608@N03", "iconserver": "3099", "datecreate": "1372269620", "_content": "Thanks, artolog, for supplying Mackensen's full name and dates.
