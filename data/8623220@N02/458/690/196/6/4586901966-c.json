Ladova (check spelling), arrested in the July 1913 for refusing to swim in a skirted bathing costume.  &quot;Dr. Ladova is an expert swimmer and is accustomed to wear a heavy two-piece bathing suit with full bloomers.  This morning, feeling hampered by the skirt, she laid it at the water's edge and swam out into the lake.  She was followed by one of the life guards, who told her to put on the skirt or submit to arrest....  'Men have absolutely no right to go around with their limbs bare and compel women to wear cumbersome suits,' she said.  'The system is wrong.  Men and women should bathe separately, and women should not be persecuted when they dress as comfortably as men do.'&quot;\n\nApparently the judge dismissed the charge of disorderly conduct, ruling her outfit not indecent.", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-4586901966-72157623889007547", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4586901966/#comment72157624013979098", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1273273432", "_content": "Here she is again:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4586273969/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4586901966-72157624013979098", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4586901966/#comment72157624014295654", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1273278015", "_content": "LOC --- Your title should read &quot;Ladova,&quot; not Ladoya.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4586901966-72157624014295654", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4586901966/#comment72157624053469832", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1273766567", "_content": "pennylrichardsca: \n\nThank you for providing Dr. Ladoya's full name and the details of such an interesting story!
