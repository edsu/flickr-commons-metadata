There are 40,000 Bain negatives according to the Library of Congress. If they are releasing them at a rate of 40 per week it will take 1,000 weeks to complete the project. With 52 weeks in the year it will take 19.2 years to complete the project. We can round that up to 20 years since most weeks there are less than 40, and for several weeks none were posted. \n\nThe LOC also has a newspaper scanning project that is equally slow paced.  \n\nFor a comparison, Google Books started in 2004 and scanned 10 millions books by the end of 2009. That is 2 million books a year, or 40K books a week, if they take of two weeks for vacation, which I am sure they do not.\n\nAnyone else have thoughts on the pace of the project?", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-4586903144-72157624025050740", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4586903144/#comment72157623925122899", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1273706454", "_content": "Richard, another problem is that LOC keeps interleaving other batches of photos in here, interrupting the Bain flow.
