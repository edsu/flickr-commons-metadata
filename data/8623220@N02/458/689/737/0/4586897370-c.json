While in New York, Bramwell Booth also visited his sister Eva, head of the United States' branch of the Army, and his brother, General Ballington Booth, the head of the Volunteers of America, an organization which had broken away from the Salvation Army, 17 years earlier.\n\nBramwell Booth (1856-1929) was the second General of the Salvation Army, succeeding his father, William Booth, founder of the organization. Bramwell's sister, Evangeline (Eva) Booth (1865-1950), became the Army's fourth General (1934-39). A naturalized U. S. citizen, Eva was the Army's Commander of the United States from 1904 to 1934. These photos, dated November 26, 1913 (the day before Thanksgiving), show the parade of Salvation Army faithful who accompanied Bramwell to the docks that morning to see him off for England aboard the &quot;France,&quot; a ship of the French Line.\n\nNew York Times story, November 25, 1913:\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9C03EED71E3BE633A25756C2A9679D946296D6CF\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9C03E...</a>", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4586897370-72157624014507972", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4586897370/#comment72157624096695362", "realname": "Kristi", "path_alias": "kristi_loc", "author": "34904489@N07", "iconserver": "3309", "datecreate": "1274306120", "_content": "Wystan:\n\nThanks for the information on the Booths.
