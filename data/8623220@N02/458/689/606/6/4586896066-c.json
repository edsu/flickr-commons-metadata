Early in 1914, when Tampico was under martial law, some U.S. Marines were arrested there, but they were quickly released, with apologies. Admiral Henry T. Mayo insisted that Mexico fire a twenty-one gun salute to the American flag, and President Woodrow Wilson supported this demand. When Mexico refused to comply, Wilson ordered a fleet to Veracruz. Troops landed on 21 April 1914 and, aided by bombardment, took the city, with an American loss of seventeen killed and sixty-three wounded. American political pressure forced Huerta out in July; he fled to Jamaica.&quot;", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4586896066-72157624014853722", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4586896066/#comment72157623892813087", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "91829349@N00", "iconserver": "5466", "datecreate": "1273327414", "_content": "Looks like it was taken from the deck of a ship in the water, so the horizon was probably moving.
