We will add his full name as well as spell out Spanish in the title.\n\nAs regular travelers in the Bain Collection in Flickr, it may interest you to know we processed the collection with caption information from two main sources: caption cards and the negatives themselves. (As noted in the Notes area in the record.) The records were primarily created from the caption cards, and sometimes later amended with information from the negatives (or negative sleeves). \n\nThis is why you will often see differences between the information recorded in the title area and the information on the image itself.  \n\nThanks for your input!", "authorname": "Kristi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-4586277497-72157623937593429", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4586277497"}}
