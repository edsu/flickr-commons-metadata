Coincidentally, the photo 2 in front of this one in the news stream was taken at the other end of Essex Market Place, at the Ludlow corner, in front of the Ludlow Street Jail.  The buildings on both sides of this block have been demolished since this photo was taken.  The building on the northeast corner of Essex and Broome, just visible in back of the wagon at the very top under the word July, is still there. The details of the spirited conversations, pushcart vendors and street life on the Lower East Side in general are well captured.\nIt's not unlikely that the same photographer took both photos on the same day.\nThis picture is wonderful in the highest resolution at <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ggbain.19510\" rel=\"nofollow\">hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ggbain.19510</a> .\nThe view from the approximate location, at street level, in July, 2011:\n<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?q=62+essex+street,+nyc&amp;ll=40.716816,-73.989087&amp;spn=0.002553,0.004294&amp;sll=40.717073,-73.988503&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,11.49,,0,18.28&amp;cbll=40.71701,-73.98899&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=62+Essex+St,+New+York,+10002&amp;t=m&amp;z=19&amp;panoid=9KtOpmOD_XotmOl19-lDwA\" rel=\"nofollow\">maps.google.com/maps?q=62+essex+street,+nyc&amp;ll=40.716...</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8169427094/\" title=\"Thaw Trial -- crowd outside court  (LOC) by The Library of Congress, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8479/8169427094_7205319ab3_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"164\" alt=\"Thaw Trial -- crowd outside court  (LOC)\" /></a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-8169426896-72157631987852650", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "8169426896"}}
