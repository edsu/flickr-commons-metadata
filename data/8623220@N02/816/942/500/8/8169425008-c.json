People now are exposed to images of others and have become completely self-conscious and self-aware because of it.  Most of these boys had probably only seen a handful of photos at this point.  There's still such an easiness in front of the camera - they don't know that they &quot;should&quot; look a certain way.  They just look the way they look and people accept them for it.  There are a few looking at the camera, but I think it's more out of curiosity than anything else - maybe a feeling of &quot;I can't believe someone's making a picture of me.&quot;", "authorname": "horsenbuggy", "id": "8602872-8169425008-72157632058670250", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "8169425008"}}
