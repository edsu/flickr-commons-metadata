John Jacob Astor IV on May 4, 1912, as it entered Trinity Church Cemetery. An estimated 5,000 people came to watch the funeral, although only a few with special passes were admitted past the cemetery gate. The view is eastward up the steep block along West 155th Street from Riverside Drive, toward Broadway. The buildings to the left are part of the Audubon Terrace complex (1908) that housed the Hispanic Society of America, the American Academy of Arts &amp; Letters, the Museum of the American Indian-Heye Foundation, the American Geographical Society, the American Numismatic Society and the Church of Our Lady of Esperanza.", "authorname": "Eric K.
