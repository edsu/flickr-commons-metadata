The uncle did not inherit the title of Graf (Count), but it was granted to him in 1870, for the services he rendered to the nation. The nephew never held a comital title, and thus could not be the Count in this Bain photo.\n\nIf this photo does not depict a Danish Greve (Count) Moltke (about whom I can find nothing on the Internet), then he must be the heir of Wilhelm Graf von Moltke (1845-1905), whose ancestral title was tied to the ownership of Kreisau.
