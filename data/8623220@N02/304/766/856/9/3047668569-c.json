Hyde then left the country, so when these photographs were made, in 1913, he was living in exile in Paris. \n\nHere is some biographical info, from an online description of James Hazen Hyde's papers in the collections of the New York Historical Society (the New York Public Library also has a collection of his papers):\n\n&quot;James Hazen Hyde (1876-1959) was a businessman, francophile, and expatriate. He graduated from Harvard in 1898. In 1899 he was left in charge of his father's (Henry Baldwin Hyde, 1834-1899) life insurance company, the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. In 1905 Hyde lost control of the company in a publicity scandal that resulted in an investigation of the insurance industry by the New York State. In late December 1905 Hyde sailed for Paris, where he lived until the Nazi occupation. \n\n&quot;Collection consists of correspondence, diaries, scrapbooks and other papers from 1891-1941 pertaining to his interest in Franco-American relations, e.g., F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de l'Alliance, Cercle Fran\u00e7ais de l'Universit\u00e9 Harvard, American Field Service Fellowships, American lecture tours by French professors, his work in the American Red Cross in France during World War I, his social life, anecdotes and comments about prominent persons, especially in French government, military, and educational circles, personal affairs, etc.&quot;", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-3047668569-72157624700766357", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3047668569/#comment72157624700782209", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1283005552", "_content": "Another Bain/LOC photo of Hyde in his library:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3047668719/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-3047668569-72157624700782209", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3047668569"}}
