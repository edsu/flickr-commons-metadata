Have you found another picture of this Allen Thurman that would confirm his identity?  I see that we have a close variant up (<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3276251809/\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3276251809/</a>, and a suggestion that he was was head of the The American Association (AA) of baseball that we were unable to confirm. \n\nI have found the Thurman with the baseball connection spelled &quot;Allan&quot; in a biographical reference source (<em>The Biographical History of Baseball</em>), and spelled &quot;Allen&quot; in the New York Times.  The Bain caption has the name as &quot;Allan&quot; in the alternate view, and yet the senior Thurman spelled it &quot;Allen.&quot;  It would be great if we could pin down both his identity and the spelling, once and for all!", "authorname": "Barbara (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-3597341445-72157620730539270", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3597341445/#comment72157620751362710", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1246334799", "_content": ". . . . be even better if we could establish his connection with Uma!", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-3597341445-72157620751362710", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3597341445"}}
