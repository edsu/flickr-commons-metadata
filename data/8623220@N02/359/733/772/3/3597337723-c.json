C., in June, 1912, when Taft was the incumbent President. This was his second experience of the notification ritual. The committee had traveled from the Republican National Convention in Chicago, where Taft had been nominated for a second term. In the era before a candidate attended the convention in person, this was his ceremonial acceptance.\n\nBut of course, Taft went down to defeat in November. Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic candidate, was victorious, and Theodore Roosevelt, leader of the Bull Moose Party, came in second.\n\nIn the Bain Company files at LOC is a photo of Taft's 1908 notification, in Cincinnati (his home town) -- but LOC has not yet posted that photo on Flickr.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-3597337723-72157622101495477", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3597337723"}}
