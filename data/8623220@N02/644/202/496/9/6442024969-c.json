What's throwing me however, is the location of this shot. 2FunAdGuyz is selling a poster showing a crew team lifting their shell out of or into the water at what appears to be the same location as this Bain image.  <a href=\"http://www.the2funadguyz.com/unwi19rocrpo.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.the2funadguyz.com/unwi19rocrpo.html</a> They label the team, perhaps incorrectly, Univ. of Wisconsin varsity rowing team, on the Hudson River near Poughkeepsie.
