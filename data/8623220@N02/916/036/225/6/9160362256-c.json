The background on this image is that I bought it from Heritage Auctions and the soldier was Id'd as Philip Nail.  They advertised him as a member of the 42nd NC Infantry.  When I looked him up in the CW database, I found a Philip Nail in the 13th NC Infantry.  I thought both possibilities were wrong because of the lone &quot;3&quot; on his hat.  I never even thought about the fact that the 3rd NC Volunteers were the same as the 13th NC Infantry.  I believe this soldier is absolutely Philip Nail of the 13th NC Infantry.", "authorname": "confederateimages", "id": "8602872-9160362256-72157635577740531", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9160362256/#comment72157635659275994", "realname": "Greg", "path_alias": "greg_loc", "author": "35075914@N06", "iconserver": "3352", "datecreate": "1379615927", "_content": "Thanks.
