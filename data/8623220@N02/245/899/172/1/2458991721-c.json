Apparently some associates rented 3 apartments and furniture for each and L and G were arrested in one of these hide outs.  They came to Woodward Ave after they returned from the <b>Catskills</b> (Parksville) where they had been previously.  The newspaper reports suggest that there were several special investigations going on at once because of articles in the newspaper suggesting that some police officers were suppressing evidence (letters), perhaps because they were somehow involved in the murder.
