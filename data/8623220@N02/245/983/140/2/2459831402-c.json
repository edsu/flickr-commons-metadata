Through most of his career he fought as a middleweight, usually at just over 160 lb. He was fighting as early as August 19, 1911, when he was 16 years old.  <a href=\"http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=55208&amp;cat=boxer\">Here's his bout list  page at BoxRec</a>. As is recorded there, by the middle of 1912 he was already over 130 lb., so this photo was most likelyly taken early that year or late in 1911. \n\nAn excerpt from his obituary is quoted on <a href=\"http://www.harrygreb.com/kosweeney.html\">this page</a>. Both there and at BoxRec, the spelling of his real name is given as John Kraynack, rather than the &quot;Kraynak&quot; currently featured on his Wikipedia page. Odds are it's Wikipedia that's got it wrong.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-2459831402-72157604852491096", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2459831402/#comment72157604935680898", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1210192959", "_content": "whyaduck: We appreciate the extra info.
