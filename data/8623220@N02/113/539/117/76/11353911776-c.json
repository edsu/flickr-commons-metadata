Six days later, a multi-reel filmed record of the bout was shipped out to theaters all over New York State. Though Willard was not at peak form, he managed to win the fight in a TKO after ten full rounds. The outcome of the fight was subject for debate, but the film clearly showed that Willard won fair and square. Over 13,000 spectators saw the Willard-Moran fight &quot;live,&quot; but many times that number were able to witness the bout from the comfort of their movie-theater seats.", "authorname": "Manatee County Public Library", "id": "8602872-11353911776-72157638642494503", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/11353911776/#comment72157638700533673", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1387126017", "_content": "This is the second Madison Square Garden, the last of the four Gardens to actually be on Madison Square, at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Broadway at 23rd Street in New York.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden_(1890)\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden_(1890)</a>.", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-11353911776-72157638700533673", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "11353911776"}}
