From August 1916 his appointment as Quartermaster general made him joint head (with Paul von Hindenburg), and chief engineer behind the management of Germany's effort in World War I until his resignation in October 1918.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Ludendorff\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Ludendorff</a>\n&quot;Paul Ludwig Hans Anton von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg, known universally as Paul von Hindenburg; 2 October 1847 \u2013 2 August 1934) was a Prussian-German field marshal, statesman, and politician, and served as the second President of Germany from 1925 to 1934.\nHindenburg enjoyed a long career in the Prussian Army, retiring in 1911. He was recalled at the outbreak of World War I, and first came to national attention, at the age of 66, as the victor at Tannenberg in 1914. As Germany's Chief of the General Staff from 1916, he and his deputy, Erich Ludendorff, rose in the German public's esteem until Hindenburg gradually gained more influence in Germany than the Kaiser himself.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Hindenburg\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Hindenburg</a>\nLudendorff, much later, with Adolf Hitler:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/32705854@N04/7615057396/\" title=\"LUDENDORFF - HITLER by old school paul, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8164/7615057396_0a24552cf5_m.jpg\" width=\"176\" height=\"240\" alt=\"LUDENDORFF - HITLER\" /></a>\n\nAn interesting account of Ludendorff from 1917, by H.L.
