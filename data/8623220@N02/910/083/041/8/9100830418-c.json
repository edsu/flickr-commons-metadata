On August 2, 1914, the Emden, a German light cruiser, was steaming peacefully off the China coast when over its wireless came the message that the German Empire was at war. The ship was made ready for action. Sailing to the Indian Ocean under orders, the Emden sank some twenty merchant vessels - most of them British - a Russian cruiser, and a French destroyer.\n\n&quot;What followed was a six-month voyage that took the Emden and its crew halfway around the world, fighting heroic battles both on land and at sea, culminating in a dramatic journey across the Arabian desert, which saw the crew survive attacks of malaria, typhus, dysentery, and the murderous onslaught of Lawrence of Arabia's bedouin tribesmen.&quot;\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-9100830418-72157634252967254", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9100830418/#comment72157634253518882", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "8139976@N03", "iconserver": "6229", "datecreate": "1371842144", "_content": "Slight correction of the note: the name of the ship is &quot;Ayesha&quot;, not Dyesha.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellmuth_von_M\u00fccke\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellmuth_von_M\u00fccke</a>\n\nThe picture was taken on the occasion of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant von M\u00fccke's wedding with Carla Finke in June 1915, after his and his men's adventurous return from the South Seas via the Arab peninsula and Constantinople: \n<a href=\"http://books.google.de/books?id=8uDIrtb5DzEC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=Hellmuth+von+M\u00fccke+++Carla&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nVYHO6Q9E7&amp;sig=VPb24EVLf2rNyu6lXa8aWgSo0n8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8abEUe3zOIKbtAbz9IHYDA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hellmuth von M\u00fccke + Carla&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.de/books?id=8uDIrtb5DzEC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg...</a>", "authorname": "xiphophilos", "id": "8602872-9100830418-72157634253518882", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/9100830418/#comment72157634255025234", "realname": "", "path_alias": "toots", "author": "61849735@N00", "iconserver": "79", "datecreate": "1371848673", "_content": "Thanks Pixel.
