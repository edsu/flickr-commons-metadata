Angle</b> in March, 1915, for manslaughter in the death of her friend Waldo R. Ballou in Stamford, (Fairfield County) Connecticut in June, 1914. \n\nThe trial was held in the Superior Court at Bridgeport, Connecticut, the county seat of Fairfield County. The all male jury had an average age of fifty, the youngest was thirty five.\n\nThe question before the jury was, did Waldo Ballou, Helen Angle's elderly suitor, fall down the stairs from Helen's apartment, after calling on her late one night, fracturing his skull... or was he, as the State contends, pushed -- or hit over the head with an iron?\n\nJudge Williams twice warned the lawyers and press against untimely disclosure or discussions of the evidence to be introduced. He said that under Connecticut law any one making public testimony in advance of its introduction in court would be open to a charge of contempt.\n\nMrs Angle took the stand in her own defense, and <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F70613FE3E5A15738DDDAE0994DB405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">told her version</a> of what happened on the night of June 23, 1914.  More than 500 people were turned away from the packed courtroom.\n\nAfter a twelve day trial the jury deliberated for one hour and forty-five minutes before returning a verdict of not guilty, after three ballots.  \n\nPrior to his appointment to the bench, Judge William H. Williams was State's \nAttorney for New Haven County, and a partner in the firm of Wooster, Williams &amp; Gager. &nbsp;[<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F70613FE3E5A15738DDDAE0994DB405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>]  [<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F6091EFE3E5A15738DDDA90A94DB405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>] [<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F20612FF355C13738DDDA10A94D8415B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a>]  [<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F10911FA395C13738DDDAD0894DB405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">4</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.archive.org/stream/menofmarkinconne04osbo/menofmarkinconne04osbo_djvu.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">5</a>]\n\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-7073604469-72157629808634543", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7073604469/#comment72157629854983481", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jon_loc", "author": "63860770@N07", "iconserver": "2794", "datecreate": "1334864472", "_content": "Thanks Pixel Wrangler, we will add his full name to our record.", "authorname": "Jon (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-7073604469-72157629854983481", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "7073604469"}}
