Here is an online historical description of what happened, from &quot;The Rise of Political Woman in the Election of 1912,&quot; by Jo Freeman (2003):\n\n&quot;. . . The WNW&amp;MO organized mass meetings for women throughout New York City. [Daisy] Harriman was often surprised to find that more men than women came to her meetings. At her first mass meeting on August 20th in Union Square, Harriman found herself addressing a crowd of 388 men and boys, but only 12 women. She asked the men to pass on her remarks to their wives, overlooking the fact that New York women were being appealed to solely so they could influence their husbands\u2019 votes. All went smoothly until Harriman and her band pulled out campaign buttons and started to toss them to the crowd. In the men\u2019s rush to grab the trinkets, the rally almost became a riot, and the police had to be called in. (New York Post, 8/20/12 [12], New York World, New York Herald, 8/21/12 [14], New York Globe, 8/21/12 [16]). This got more press coverage than anything the women had to say.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/polhistory/1912.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/polhistory/1912.htm</a>", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2368281179-72157624253984770", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2368281179/#comment72157624743267743", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1283487531", "_content": "A Bain/LOC photo shows some of the boys in the crowd, eager to catch the campaign buttons that Mrs. Harriman is tossing at them:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2369111942/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2368281179-72157624743267743", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2368281179/#comment72157624746890913", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1283536106", "_content": "Mrs. Vibbirt addresses the political rally in Union Square, New York, sponsored by the Woman's National Wilson and Marshall Organization (August 20, 1912):\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3276245169/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2948784299/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2368281179-72157624746890913", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2368281179/#comment72157625176665935", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1288756013", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Jaffray_Harriman\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Jaffray_Harriman</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-2368281179-72157625176665935", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2368281179/#comment72157625321428224", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1289009284", "_content": "A formal Bain/LOC portrait of Mrs. Harriman:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5126121442/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2368281179-72157625321428224", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2368281179/#comment72157627147074887", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1311539119", "_content": "More Bain photos of Daisy Harriman, from the August, 1914, photostream:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5963838071/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2368281179-72157627147074887", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2368281179"}}
