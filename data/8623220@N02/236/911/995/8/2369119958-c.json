Note the squarish tail.\n\nThe rounded tail of the flying boat in the photo above was a feature of Curtiss's second such craft, the America, built in 1914. Photos of the America and a modern reproduction of it are on <a href=\"http://www.glennhcurtissmuseum.org/museum/restoration.htm\">this page</a> at the Glenn Curtiss Museum website.\n\nCurtiss tested his flying boats near Hammondsport, on Lake Keuka in the Finger Lakes district of upstate New York. The America was tested on July 12, 1914, and was the subject of <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990CE0DB143AE633A25750C1A9619C946596D6CF\">this New York Times article</a> the following day. Note that the article cites the speed of the craft as 60 mph, matching the speed cited in the caption on this Bain photo. A 1912 Times report on the testing of the Flying Fish gives the top speed of that craft as 54 mph. The photo above almost certainly depicts the America, probably on July 12, 1914.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-2369119958-72157606268708191", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2369119958/#comment72157606295951800", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1216665563", "_content": "whyaduck: Thanks for this information.
