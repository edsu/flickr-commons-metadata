Here are some clues from the history of these folks:  \r\n\r\nOn the right: Greek <b>Prince Christopher</b> (1888-1940).   His father was originally a Danish prince (does Christopher look Danish?).  Through an unusual twist of history, his Danish father  (1845-1913) became <b>King George I</b> of Greece in 1863 when he was only 17.  King George had a long rule of 50 years and he was married for 46 years  to <b> Olga Konstantinovna</b> (1851-1926) of Russia, they married in 1867.   (That seems to be her, in the middle of the photo).  They had 8 children, including Christopher who was the youngest.  King George was assassinated in 1913 at age 68 (during the first Balkan war).  Christopher was then age 25.  Queen Olga, age 62, became a dowager at this point, another word for a widow.  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_I_of_Greece\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_I_of_Greece</a>\r\n\r\nGeorge was succeeded by his and Olga's oldest son who became <b> King Constantine</b> (1868-1923), who was Christopher's brother.  Constantine was educated at Heidelberg University in Germany, trained in the Prussian army, and married to a nice Prussian girl, <b>Princess Sophie of Prussia</b> (1870-1932).  On her mother's side Sophie's grandparents were <b>Queen Victoria</b> and <b>Prince Albert</b> of England.  Her grandfather on her father's side was German emperor and her father was German emperor too and so was her brother,  <b>Kaiser Wilhelm II</b> of Germany.  \r\n\r\nConstantine was king of Greece from 1913-1917.   During World War I Greece was neutral but eventually sided with the Allies.  Constantine was was forced to abdicate and leave Greece due to his pro-German affiliations and sympathies.  He abdicated in favor of his second son (and Olga's grandson) <b> Alexander </b> who did not last long as king.  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I_of_Greece\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I_of_Greece</a>", "authorname": "Harry Angstrom", "id": "8602872-2369119062-72157604287369136", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2369119062/#comment72157604288524066", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11572312@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1206749764", "_content": "Alexander (1893-1920) was king from 1917 to 1920.

This scandal led to King Alexander having to flee to Paris.  He returned but not long after he died of bites from an altercation in the garden with his two pet monkeys.  He was 27.  (Not making this up!)  Alexander died in October 1920 and his grandmother, Olga, served as <b> Regent of Greece</b> until her son Constantine could return from exile in Switzerland to be king for a second time.   He abdicated for the second time, in 1922.  \r\n\r\nPrince Christopher married a wealthy American widow in early 1920.  He was later to become an uncle of the current Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_Konstantinovna_of_Russia\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_Konstantinovna_of_Russia</a>  \r\n       \r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I_of_Greece\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I_of_Greece</a>\r\n  \r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_of_Prussia\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_of_Prussia</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Greece\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Greece</a>\r\n \r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Aspasia\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Aspasia</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Christopher_of_Greece_and_Denmark\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Christopher_of_Greece_and_De...</a>", "authorname": "Harry Angstrom", "id": "8602872-2369119062-72157604288524066", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2369119062/#comment72157604293304195", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "11572312@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1206750553", "_content": "Olga (1851-1926)\r\nChristopher: (1888-1940)\r\nAspasia (1896-1972)\r\n\r\nIf we guess that this is around the time of Aspasia's secret wedding on November 4, 1919 (or Alexander's funeral in 1920) then Olga has been a widow for 6 years and she is 68 in this pic, Chris would be age 31 and Aspasia age 23.

Hence, she was certainly a  widow as you say.\r\n\r\nThe Dowager is also wearing a widow's peak, or mourning hat - although I have never seen one worn in white before.  I assume it is white in celebration of the wedding.\r\n\r\nYou may recall many photographs of Queen Victoria wearing a similar headdress, but always in black as mourning for her beloved Prince Albert.  \r\n\r\nSure looks like a wedding day pic to me, and certainly Aspasia is older than 16 years in this pic.

White mourning was first a privilege of Queens of France.  Numerous other queens adopted the practice.  There is a famous portrait of Mary Queen of Scots in white mourning for her first husband Francis II of France.  However, black mourning was adopted by Catherine de Medici (Mary's first mother-in-law) upon the death of her husband Henri II, and she wore it for the rest of her life.  Black mourning then increasingly became the norm for Queens.  When Marie Antoinette was taken to be executed she was instructed by her jailers not to wear black mourning, and was provided with a white dress and mob cap.  Ironically it seems they didn't realize they were unwittingly giving her the privilege of white mourning which was reserved for Queens.\n\nQueen Elizabeth the Queeen Mother, while Queen Consort to George VI caused a sensation during a state visit to France in which she wore all white during her entire visit.  Her mother the Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorn had recently died, and in order not to cast a pall on the state visit with black clothing, the Queen decided to adopt white mourning for her mother.  Even more recently the Duch Royal family adopted white mourning upon the death of former Queen Juliana.", "authorname": "skibriye", "id": "8602872-2369119062-72157615944704170", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2369119062/#comment72157621864025127", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1249828716", "_content": "Original photo was blindstamped in lower right corner: \n&quot;Thalmand Freres [Brothers]\nMontreux-Vevey [Switzerland]&quot;\n\nThere's also a date inscribed down there, \nbut it may be both upside-down and backwards.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2369119062-72157621864025127", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2369119062/#comment72157623068545804", "realname": "", "path_alias": "greekpunk", "author": "70906576@N00", "iconserver": "3277", "datecreate": "1261770616", "_content": "great photo!!", "authorname": "greekpunk", "id": "8602872-2369119062-72157623068545804", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2369119062/#comment72157623098661536", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mando_gal", "author": "8110957@N08", "iconserver": "5446", "datecreate": "1262149232", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/69656089@N00/\">Vintage Monocle</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Mando Maniac", "id": "8602872-2369119062-72157623098661536", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "2369119062"}}
