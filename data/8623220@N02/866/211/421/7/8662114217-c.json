Touche\nFounder\n\nGeorge A. Touche apprenticed as an accountant in Edinburgh before traveling to London and qualifying as a chartered accountant in 1883. After practicing for six years, he was appointed secretary of the Industrial and General Trust. This appointment was his first involvement with investment trusts, a field in which he would become an acknowledged expert.\n\nAlthough best remembered for the accounting companies he founded, Touche was also deeply involved in civic life. He was a member of Parliament for North Islington from 1910 to 1918. In recognition of his many achievements, Touche was knighted in 1917 and appointed a baronet three years later.\n\nTouche was actually born with the surname Touch (pronounced in Scotland to rhyme with &quot;loch&quot;). But his name, when mispronounced &quot;Tutch&quot; by the English, had negative connotations. The Oxford Standard Dictionary gave one definition of &quot;touch&quot; as &quot;to wheedle a sum of money out of someone,&quot; which Touche felt was hardly appropriate for an accountant. In 1906, therefore, he changed his name to Touche, its ancient Scottish spelling.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_US/us/About/History/Leaders-Shapers/ffc8855bb41fb110VgnVCM100000ba42f00aRCRD.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.deloitte.com/view/en_US/us/About/History/Leaders-Shap...</a>", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-8662114217-72157633360279420", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "8662114217"}}
