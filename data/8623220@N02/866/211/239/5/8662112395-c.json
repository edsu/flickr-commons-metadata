Belcher, James E. Davis, Christian F. Schilt (awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroics in Nicaragua in 1928, and ultimately rising to the rank of four-star Marine Corps general upon retirement in 1957), and Hubert H. Dogan (the caption of &quot;Dogant&quot; is incorrect), all Marine Corps aviators who would take part in a surveying mission photographing the northern coast of Cuba in 1927.  The surveying mission is cited on page 26 of the October 2, 1927 edition of the San Antonio Express (&quot;Types of Plane for the New Aircraft-Carriers&quot;): \n\n<i>&quot;The Navy Bureau of Aeronautics is well satisfied with the work of Marine Corps flyers in the West Indies, during which they photographed 400 miles of Cuba's northern coast.  Two Loening amphibians were employed; Capt. James E. Davis and Lieut. Christian F. Schlit were the pilots.  Sergeants B.F. Belcher and H.H. Dogan completed the expedition's personnel.\n\n&quot;Most of the region between Cardenas - 75 miles east of Havana - and Nuevitas in Camaguey Province is fringed with islands called cayos.  The survey extended from Havana to Nuevitas, and it has given the Hydrographic Office (a Navy bureau) a more nearly accurate map of that sector.&quot;</i>", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "8602872-8662112395-72157633309164598", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8662112395/#comment72157633380705292", "realname": "Karen", "path_alias": "kchi_loc", "author": "34985608@N03", "iconserver": "3099", "datecreate": "1367256156", "_content": "B-59: Thanks for catching the date on the photo!", "authorname": "kchi (LOC P&P)", "id": "8602872-8662112395-72157633380705292", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8662112395/#comment72157633380713460", "realname": "Karen", "path_alias": "kchi_loc", "author": "34985608@N03", "iconserver": "3099", "datecreate": "1367256224", "_content": "TVL1970: Thanks for the excellent information.
