S. Suffragist leader, and the venerable Dr. Anna Howard Shaw.\n\nMrs. Pankhurst made a return visit to America in October, 1913. On that occasion, foolish U. S. immigration officials decided to bar entry to her, holding her at Ellis Island for deportation. This created a cause celebre, and required the personal intervention of U. S. President Woodrow Wilson to admit her for an already-scheduled lecture tour. The publicity helped suffragist fundraising enormously.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2423482538-72157625462390486", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2423482538"}}
