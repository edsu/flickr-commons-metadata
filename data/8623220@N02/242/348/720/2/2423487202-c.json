The son of militant abolitionists (his father, Erastus Cravath, was the founding president of Fisk University), Cravath graduated from Oberlin in 1882 and from Columbia College law school in 1886. He married Agnes Huntington, a former opera singer, in 1892. His law firm, now   Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore LLP, remains one of the most succesful in the world. \r\n\r\nVera Agnes Huntington Cravath (b.1896), who appears with him in this photo,  was his daughter. The occasion was probably a horse race or horse show. Both Cravath and his daughter, an avid horsewoman,  exhibited show horses during the period when this photo was taken. Vera Cravath married at least twice: to Lt. James S. Larkin, about 1917, and to William Francis Gibbs in 1927.", "authorname": "whyaduck", "id": "8602872-2423487202-72157604617569313", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2423487202/#comment72157604626437336", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1208651363", "_content": "Thanks!
