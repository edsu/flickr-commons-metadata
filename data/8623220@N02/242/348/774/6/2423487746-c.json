It has several advantages over other kinds of rechargeable cells, the main one being that it lasts forever and is immune to physical and electrical abuse. In comparison, lithium cells only last three years no matter how much you use them, and just a few deep discharges or overcharges can kill a NiMH cell.", "authorname": "Jim Rees", "id": "8602872-2423487746-72157604617899790", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2423487746/#comment72157604628885131", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1208642995", "_content": "Swang: Thanks for the source.
