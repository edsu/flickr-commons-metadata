He understated Rothstein's talents; he tragically overestimated Rosenthal. In 1912 Rosenthal was running a gambling house at 104 W. 45th Street with Lt. Charles Becker (1873-1915), head of the NYPD vice squad\u2014and overlord of a widespread system of Police shakedowns. When the two fell out, Becker put Rosenthal out of business. Rosenthal\u2014despite Rothstein's warnings\u2014threatened to blow the lid off &quot;The System,&quot; finally taking his story to Herbert Bayard Swope (best man at Rothstein's wedding) at the New York World. In July 1912 the World printed Rosenthal's story.\r\n\r\nAn enraged Becker ordered Rosenthal's death, and a quartet of killers\u2014Jacob Seidenshner (aka Whitet Lewis), Frank &quot;Dago Frank&quot; Cirofici, Louis &quot;Lefty Louie&quot; Rosenberg and Harry &quot;Gyp the Blood&quot; Horowitz\u2014rubbed out Rosenthal as he exited Big Tim Sullivan's Metropole Hotel at 142 West 43rd Street, just off Times Square, on the evening of July 16, 1912.\r\n\r\nThe four gunmen were found guilty of Rosenthal's murder on November 19, 1912.'\r\n\r\nBecker was tried separately [see \r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2349132043/\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2349132043/</a>] and convicted.  The first conviction (October 1912) was overturned but he was tried again a couple of years later.  All five were executed.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.crimemagazine.com/killercop.htm\">www.crimemagazine.com/killercop.htm</a>  \r\n<a href=\"http://sixforfive.blogspot.com/2007/02/harry-horowitz-aka-gyp-blood-1889-1914.html\">sixforfive.blogspot.com/2007/02/harry-horowitz-aka-gyp-bl...</a>\r\n  and\r\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=29R4MyhnVb4C&amp;pg=PT55&amp;lpg=PT55&amp;dq=gunmen+jury+1912+november&amp;source=web&amp;ots=fMd-f1bZmk&amp;sig=FxFtusI0mYd1arzK5qwmdTFgrt8&amp;hl=en\">books.google.com/books?id=29R4MyhnVb4C&amp;pg=PT55&amp;lp...</a>", "authorname": "swanq", "id": "8602872-2423488718-72157604615131842", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2423488718/#comment72157604630249047", "realname": "", "path_alias": "library_of_congress", "author": "8623220@N02", "iconserver": "3703", "datecreate": "1208649826", "_content": "We'll add a subject note to our home catalog record to identify the event, and then probably link back here  for the rest of the story!", "authorname": "The Library of Congress", "id": "8602872-2423488718-72157604630249047", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2423488718/#comment72157625462287192", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1290638422", "_content": "Other Bain/LOC photos of characters involved in the Gunmen's Trial:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2422673845/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2765464748/]\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2423488522/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2423488718-72157625462287192", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2423488718/#comment72157629803016602", "realname": "", "path_alias": "rainbows_photo_gallery", "author": "78912708@N07", "iconserver": "8316", "datecreate": "1337457700", "_content": "Curious to see only one woman or girl by herself in the crowd.", "authorname": "rainbow6562011", "id": "8602872-2423488718-72157629803016602", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2423488718/#comment72157629804177456", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1337463623", "_content": "rainbow, if you look closely you will see that there are two little girls together -- maybe the judge's daughters?", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-2423488718-72157629804177456", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "2423488718"}}
