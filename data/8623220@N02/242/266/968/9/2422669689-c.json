P. Taylor. The race was a revival of an earlier annual event; there had been no coach race in 1911. It was delayed twice by accidents on the course, which were caused by horses slipping on asphalt pavement. \n\nThe 1912 race began at the Arrowhead Inn (built in 1908, torn down in 1923) in Washington Heights [at 178th St. (now the George Washington Bridge road, or I-95) and Haven Ave.], and ended at Madison Square Garden, where a throng of spectators waited patiently for the arrival of each coach-and-four. \n\nPresumaby this photograph shows the beginning of the 1913 race, this time with Seelig and Taylor joining forces against a competitor identified as &quot;Judge Moore.&quot; Alas, veterinarians disqualified one of the Judge's horses for lameness, and Taylor won by default. On the other hand, the 1913 NYT story says Taylor drove a yellow coach. Does the coach in the photo look yellow?
