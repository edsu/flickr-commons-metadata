Gardner was doing a portrait of my father, and he would bring Phyllis along to relax his subject during sittings.  My father adored Phyllis, and so did I.

Reared a Catholic, she had turned sharply against the Church and looked on those who remained in it with incredulity and scorn.  She had had a fling in London with Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond, I learned later... They gave excellent parties and provided Cambridge with a captivating taste of upper-class Bohemianism.&quot;\n\nPhyllis and Gardner Cox had three children, Benjamin, James, and Poppy; Phyllis was widowed when Gardner died in 1988.", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-2422675733-72157605126026585", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2422675733/#comment72157622841381423", "realname": "Richard Norton", "path_alias": "richard_arthur_norton", "author": "54904823@N00", "iconserver": "2568", "datecreate": "1260351590", "_content": "I started an entry for the club:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piping_Rock_Club\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piping_Rock_Club</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "8602872-2422675733-72157622841381423", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2422675733/#comment72157624906174874", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1283920791", "_content": "The girl at left foreground, back to camera, is Sheila Byrne.
