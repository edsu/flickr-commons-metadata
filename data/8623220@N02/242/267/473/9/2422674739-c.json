He was arrested for manslaughter on January 1st, 1919, in Boston, following the death in the ring the previous night of his opponent, a boxer who went by the name of Terry McGovern (<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B07E3DD1231E433A25752C0A9679C946896D6CF\">New York Times article</a>.) I haven't been able to find out what happened after that.  \n\nI haven't been able to identify the Williams in the photo.\n\n<b>EDIT:</b> It turns out that there were two boxers fighting under the name Young Britt during the 1910s. The Frankie &quot;Young Britt&quot; Pacheco (born 1895) in my earlier comment apparently used the name Frankie Britt for most of his career. <a href=\"http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=11928&amp;cat=boxer&amp;pageID=1\">Here's his BoxRec bout list under that name</a>. As can be seen, his career continued after the unfortunate death of Terry McGovern. \n\nThe other Young Britt  was a bantamweight named Henry Treffinger, born in 1890, whose career lasted from 1906 until 1916 (<a href=\"http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=55976&amp;cat=boxer\">BoxRec bout list</a>.) \n\nThe Williams in the photo might be <a href=\"http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/williams-k.htm\">Kid Williams</a> (aka John Gutenko), a bantamweight who was active in the ring from 1910-1929, but I can't find any evidence that he ever fought either of the Young Britts.\n\n<b>Additional Edit:</b> See comments on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2555563457/\">this photo of the same boxers</a> for more about their correct identities (Kid Williams, aka John Gutenko, and Young Britt, aka Henry Treffinger.)
