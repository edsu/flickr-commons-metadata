A chamber music series was added in 1910, and in 1913 the chamber concerts took up residence in the 1,500-seat auditorium at Washington Irving High School. The school opened that year on what had been the site of the National Conservatory of Music, which Dvorak directed briefly in the 1890's. Except for a brief period in the 1970's, when the concerts moved to Hunter College and Town Hall, Washington Irving has remained the series' principal home. (The current Town Hall series was added more recently, to address the concerns of older concertgoers who preferred daytime concerts.) &quot;", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4565503980-72157623877273923", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4565503980/#comment72157625517270714", "realname": "lady tate", "path_alias": "ladytate1", "author": "56596665@N02", "iconserver": "3689", "datecreate": "1291339912", "_content": "Thanks for the info, Wystan.... it's great whenever people leave a message to share.", "authorname": "thejbach", "id": "8602872-4565503980-72157625517270714", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4565503980"}}
