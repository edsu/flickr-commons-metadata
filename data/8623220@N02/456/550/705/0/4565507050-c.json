The last three of those fights, including the Willard bout, were at Madison Square Garden, in New York City. According to the stats online, Morris lost to Willard &quot;NWS&quot; -- but I don't know what NWS means. He lost a bout with Gunboat Smith on October 9 &quot;DQ&quot; -- I don't know what that means either, but I doubt it stands for Dairy Queen.
