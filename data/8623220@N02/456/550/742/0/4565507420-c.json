(And heavy enough, even then.)\n\nWikipedia says that Winans was born in Russia of American parents, but lived most of his life in England, and didn't actually get to hunt in The States until he was 58, ten years before he died. That would explain his distinctive British hunting costume, designed for shooting grouse on the Scottish moors.\n\nWinans with more Big Game:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4565505040/]\n\nWinans riding in his Prestashka:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162693861/]\n\nAnother shot of Winans' Prestashka:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2163469184/]\n\nWinans had a troika, too:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162668551/]\n\nFrom the Glenaffric and Strathglass [Scotland] website:\n\nTHE MILLIONAIRE STALKER\nWalter Winans, the American millionaire, who rented nearly 250,000 acres in Glen Strathfarrar, was it\u2019s most famous and most notorious sporting tenant. He also rented land at Fasnakyle, Knockfin and Glens Cannich and Affric. Before stalking was established, deer were driven to the hunters. Winans had gigantic drives, culminating between Lochs Beannacharan and a\u2019 Mhuillidh, which local stalkers considered wholesale slaughter, compared with the skill of stalking. Winans could bring down stags galloping at 100 yards, and once went so far as to paint a white horse dapple-grey - the colour lasted ten weeks and the chemicals kept the midges off!\n\nSculpture of Sitting Bull, by Winans:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2162692893/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4565507420-72157623975362542", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4565507420/#comment72157623987348090", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "21686909@N07", "iconserver": "2188", "datecreate": "1272938590", "_content": "To Peter Travolis:\n\nThe buffalo nearly became extinct because white men shot them for sport or just for their tongues and left them piled up by the hundreds of thousands along the railroad line out West.
