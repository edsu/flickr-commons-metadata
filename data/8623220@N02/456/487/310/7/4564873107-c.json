Two months later, on August 26, in Atlanta, Leo Frank (in an infamous miscarriage of justice blamed on racial excitement and antisemitism) was found guilty, after trial, of the murder of a young factory employee, Mary Phagan. The verdict became national and international news. Frank's attorneys requested an appeal of the verdict, and excitement was running high in October and November, when Bain's news agency circulated this photo of the new governor's wife to its subscribers. Was this the only photo Bain could locate near to hand? Why Georgia's first lady, and not the Governor? \n\nAfter the appeals process, which continued through 1914 and part of 1915, Governor Slaton committed political suicide by commuting Frank's sentence from death by hanging to life imprisonment. But the Georgia mob would not have it; the KKK dragged Frank out of prison and lynched him. Only in 1986 did the state of Georgia grant him a posthumous pardon.", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4564873107-72157624000875818", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4564873107/#comment72157632687008273", "realname": "Leo Frank", "path_alias": "leofrankcase", "author": "62196584@N02", "iconserver": "7025", "datecreate": "1360013258", "_content": "There was no more excitement about the murder of Mary Phagan, than there was over any other grizzly murder of a child in American history.

Those are things that a man does unconsciously and cannot tell how many times nor when he does it (Leo Frank Trial Brief of Evidence, August 18, 1913).", "authorname": "Leo Max Frank", "id": "8602872-4564873107-72157632687008273", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "4564873107"}}
