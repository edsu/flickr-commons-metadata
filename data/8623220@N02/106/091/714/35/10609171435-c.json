Roosevelt was actively campaigning for he US to enter the World War in 1916, and Marjorie's offer to contribute her weekly 10 cent allowance towards the building of a dreadnaught, would have made a great PR opportunity for TR.\n\nThe New York Times reports that TR met with Marjorie Sterrett on board the SS Guiana on February 11, 1916.  Roosevelt was on a 5 week trip to the Caribbean for health reasons.  According to the Times, Teddy greeted Marjorie with, &quot;Hello Mabel, how do you do?  I am glad to meet you and give three cheers for you and your battleship.  You are doing great work.&quot;", "authorname": "puzzlemaster", "id": "8602872-10609171435-72157637191980784", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/10609171435/#comment72157637277691193", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "66311327@N05", "iconserver": "7333", "datecreate": "1383513500", "_content": "The article about the meeting of TR with Marjorie Sterrett is here: <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F50C15FF345C13738DDDAB0994DA405B868DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\">query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F50C15FF345C13...</a>\n\nAnother photo of her: <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1916-02-06/ed-1/seq-3/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New-York tribune., February 06, 1916, Page 3</a>", "authorname": "B-59", "id": "8602872-10609171435-72157637277691193", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/10609171435/#comment72157637320296726", "realname": "Dave Miller", "path_alias": "puzzlemaster", "author": "10771167@N00", "iconserver": "5348", "datecreate": "1383603894", "_content": "I have been unable to identify Marjorie or her family in US Census records at ancestry.com.

Her parents were Fred C. Dean and Grace Rockland, both natives of Erie Co., PA.    \n\nAround 1911, Grace and Fred Dean separated, and Grace remarried Thomas Garfield Sterrett, a native of Erie who was in the newspaper business.  Tom Sterrett was a veteran of the Spanish American War, who had re-enlisted in the US Marine Corps in 1907 and seems to have split his time between New York and Pennsylvania newspaper work and military service.  In the Marines he was employed in recruiting efforts in the years before and during the USA\u2019s entry into World War I.  He is credited with having a genius for publicity and was responsible for staging public events and placing copy in newspapers in order to increase the repute of the Corps.  By 1915, Captain Sterrett was the chief of the Marine Corps\u2019 New York Publicity Bureau on East 24th Street in Manhattan.  Various records and newspaper articles give Brooklyn addresses for himself and/or his family, although they are not shown living there in any of the Federal Censuses.\n\nIn 1916 there was mounting pressure on the non-interventionist Wilson administration to ready the US armed forces for entry into the raging European war.  One of the most visible proponents of \u201cpreparedness\u201d was former president Theodore Roosevelt.  It is against this background that Captain Sterrett\u2019s pretty 13-year-old stepdaughter wrote her moving letter to the New York Tribune offering up her dime allowance to help build a battleship for the Navy.  Within a very short amount of time she was standing on the deck of the SS Guiana schmoozing with the ailing Roosevelt who very publicly had embraced Marjorie\u2019s cause and contributed dimes on behalf of his young grandchildren.  (I find it curious that Bain didn\u2019t archive a photo of TR and Marjorie together although they each are shown separately on board the ship.)\n\nMarjorie\u2019s letter generated a great deal of publicity across the US and bolstered the public acceptance of a pro-war stance.  There were deep-seated suspicions that the war was being fought for the benefit of munitions manufacturers and profiteers, and that the US should stay out of Europe\u2019s mess.  Marjorie\u2019s act provided a patriotic subtext for the hawks of that day.  The fact that her stepfather was a PR man for the armed forces was not discussed in the coverage of the story.\n\nSometime after she burst upon the public scene, Marjorie was invited to make some short films for the Edison Company.   Her film career never took off and, rather soon, was living quietly with her parents Thomas and Grace Sterrett back in Erie.  Tom Sterrett returned to the newspaper publishing business after the conclusion of the War, and by the late 1920\u2019s had been elected Sherriff of Erie County PA.   In 1920, Marjorie (under the name Marjorie Rockwood Dean) was married to Peter Raun in Erie, with whom she had several children.  Marjorie died at the age of 24 in Wattsburg, Erie Co. PA on March 2, 1927.\n\nSee also: <a href=\"http://oldtimeerie.blogspot.com/2013/11/naval-award-named-for-erie-girl_10.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">oldtimeerie.blogspot.com/2013/11/naval-award-named-for-er...</a>", "authorname": "puzzlemaster", "id": "8602872-10609171435-72157637554978226", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/10609171435/#comment72157637678260734", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1384469197", "_content": "Thank you so much for filling in a bit more of the story, puzzlemaster.
