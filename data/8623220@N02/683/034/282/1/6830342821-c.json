Van Winkle</b> (1875-1932), of Newark, New Jersey, leading the New Jersey Women's Political Union in the &quot;Handing On The Torch of Victory&quot; demonstration, on August 7, 1915.\n\nThe New York Union supplied a large bronze torch which Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer, representing New York, took with her on a tugboat half way across the Hudson River, where she was met by a New Jersey tug, the <i>A. W. Smith.</i> bearing Mrs. Van Winkle, to whom the torch was delivered.  It was sent about the State to twenty or more towns where the Union had branches and its arrival was made the occasion for an outdoor reception and mass meeting. There is a fanciful article about the steps (and missteps) of this event in <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F20E14FD3E5F17738DDDA10894D0405B858DF1D3\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>The New York Times.</i></a>\n\nA close-up of Mrs Van Winkle holding the torch on the tugboat is in the <i>Bain Collection</i> at the <i>Library of Congress:</i>\n\n<b>&quot;Mrs. Van Winkle and Suffrage torch&quot;</b> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; by <i>Bain/LOC</i>\n&nbsp; <b>&darr;</b> <i>Click On This Icon to Reload Photo</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/ggbain.19667/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/pnp/ggbain/19600/19667r.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"364\" alt=\"Mrs. Van Winkle and Suffrage torch (LOC)\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\nTaken a few years later, there is a photo on Flickr of Mrs. Van Winkle in a Uniform of Food Administration by <i>The U.S. National Archives,</i> on Flickr Commons:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/3904008774/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2567/3904008774_1d60f66968_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"515\" alt=\"Mrs. Mina C.

She Was President of Woman's Political Union of New Jersey 8 Years and Is Now Head of Lecture Bureau of Food Administration.&quot;</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by <i>The U.S. National Archives</i>\n&nbsp;\nBorn Wilhelmina (&quot;Mina&quot;) Caroline Ginger, Mina graduated from the social work program of the New York School of Philanthropy in 1905. &nbsp;In 1906 she became the second wife of Abraham Van Winkle (1838-1915), wealthy president of a chemical manufacturing company (and a widower 36 years her senior) who had financially supported the Bureau of Associated Charities. Her husband died in 1915, at age 76.\n\nThe following year the Washington D.C. Police Department began to hire policewomen. In 1918, a woman\u2019s bureau was established and Mina Van Winkle was one of four members of the Bureau. In 1919, Van Winkle became the Bureau\u2019s director, with an initial rank of detective sergeant (and, by December 1920, as a lieutenant).\n\nThe Bureau\u2019s initial responsibilities included \u201cgirl welfare work,\u201d prevention and detection of store crimes, and supervision of movie theatres, dance halls, and similar places. However, its greatest emphasis was on casework. Van Winkle stated that <i>\u201cprevention and protection are more primary than prosecution, and those who have done wrong should be intelligently aided toward a better life.\u201d</i>\n\nFrom 1919 until the time of her death, she was president and chief financial contributor of the International Association of Policewomen. The organization was disbanded following her death, but was resurrected in 1956 as the International Association of Police Women (known since 1969 as the International Association of Women Police).
