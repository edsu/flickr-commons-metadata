Liebmann; they had three children.  Clara started a school of music on the East Side teaching poor children for ten cents a lesson; here's a 1905 letter describing her program:\n<a href=\"http://cdm128401.cdmhost.com/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15052coll4/id/28/rec/9\" rel=\"nofollow\">cdm128401.cdmhost.com/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p1505...</a>\n\nIn 1914, Clara sued Henry for a separation, on the basis of cruelty (she said that he beat her often, beginning on their honeymoon; their eldest son, Joseph, confirmed that he heard frequent mistreatment); he countersued for divorce, and named eight men in his suit.  By August 1915, a Nevada divorce had been granted, and Henry had remarried to a young woman named Ida Teichman.", "authorname": "pennylrichardsca (now at ipernity)", "id": "8602872-7949419592-72157631454204914", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/7949419592/#comment72157631513037786", "realname": "", "path_alias": "ryan_loc", "author": "35234565@N04", "iconserver": "1021", "datecreate": "1347386180", "_content": "Thanks for your research pennylrichardsca.
