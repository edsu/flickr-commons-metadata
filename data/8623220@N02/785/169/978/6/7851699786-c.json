This trip's official title was the Lincoln Highway Motion Picture Film Caravan.  Here is a short description of the trip these cars are beginning:\n\n&quot;The Lincoln Highway Association also arranged a tour to the Panama-Pacific Exposition. The primarypurpose was to make a motion picture of the road as part of the association\u2019s campaign to keep the public interested in the highway. The tour began in New York on May 15, 1915, and reached San Francisco at the end of August. According to the association\u2019s official history:\nEverywhere elaborate preparations were made to show each city at its best . . . . Automobile parades, scenes of road improvement, dedications of bridges and of newly constructed sections of highway, processions of school-children, every sort of function, celebration and activity connected and unconnected with highway building was arranged for them to photograph. \nThe association, in fact, had to ask communities to replace the fire and police displays with \u201cscenes having a real interest, scenes tending to make it safe, easy, and pleasant to come your way and call on you.\u201d\nBetween cities, the party busied itself taking photographs of scenery, historic sites, road construction, maintenance, improvement, and anything else tending to interest the traveler and stimulate touring.\nWhen the touring automobiles reached San Francisco, they were placed on display between the Transportation Palace and the Palace of Manufacturers. After the exposition, the Lincoln Highway Association used the film in an eastbound publicity tour of one-night stands. \u201cIt met with high enthusiasm everywhere,\u201d according to the official history.
