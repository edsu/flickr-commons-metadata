Rasch (1891 - 1967) was a dancer and choreographer, based in New York.  She was also married to the composer Dmitri Tiomkin.\nThis and the four unidentified room photos that precede it are identified on an Historical Ziegfeld site as being of Rasch's dance studio.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertina_Rasch\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertina_Rasch</a>\n<a href=\"http://historicalziegfeld.multiply.com/photos/album/297#\" rel=\"nofollow\">historicalziegfeld.multiply.com/photos/album/297#</a>\n\nFrom a biographical sketch on the official Dmitri Tomkin website, comes the following:\n&quot;Eager to impart her experience and knowledge to teachers, other dancers, and children, she settled in New York and opened the Albertina Rasch Dance Studio in October 1923. With its inspiring view of the Hudson River, the studio offered private and group lessons in ballet and interpretative dance. Rasch\u2019s strict regimen, including body alignment and breathing exercises based on her own European training, set her dancers apart from the typical chorus-line girls who populated the New York stage. The rigorous training program gave Rasch\u2019s dancers the stamina necessary to endure long vaudeville days and nights and, later, filming that required take after take.&quot;\n<a href=\"http://www.dimitritiomkin.com/biography/albertina-rasch/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.dimitritiomkin.com/biography/albertina-rasch/</a>\n\nThese pictures therefore must date from October, 1923 or after.", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-8009362837-72157631593897246", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/8009362837/#comment72157631595995765", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "23103743@N05", "iconserver": "2155", "datecreate": "1348326931", "_content": "A section from a biography of Jeanette Macdonald starting near the bottom of <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=ojOxCgHZLpUC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=ojOxCgHZLpUC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lp...</a>\ndiscusses the influence of Rasch on Macdonald, mentioning a location for Rasch's studio in the Steinway Building on West 57th St., but not giving a date.  109-113 West 57th Street is where Steinway Hall (built in 1925) is located.  But it would not have had a view of the Hudson and the architecture doesn't match.  Presumably Rasch opened her first studio somewhere else, on the West Side of New York City.  Although buildings from this vintage are still found on Riverside Drive on the Upper West Side, the midtown area along the Hudson, which would have been closer to the theatre district, looks as though it has been completely torn up and re-developed.\n\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=4iL0a2rQzsgC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=4iL0a2rQzsgC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;l...</a>\nis a 1931 directory of schools of the theatre arts.
