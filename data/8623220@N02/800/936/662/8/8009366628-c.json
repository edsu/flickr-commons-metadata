Richardson\n\nLieutenant Colonel Edwin H. Richardson was not a shy man and portrays himself as fighting for years against institutional ignorance about the value of war dogs. Even before the war, he states that \u201cI was the sole person who took any interest in trained dogs for the army and police, and the outflow from my kennels constituted the only source of supply.\u201c\n\nWhen World War I began, Richardson tried to persuade the powers that be to let him train sentry dogs, already known to be in use by the Germans. His idea having been rejected, he began training ambulance dogs, but this came to little because the Germans did not respect \u201cthe inviolability of the sacred symbol of the Red Cross, whether on man or beast, hospital or ship.\u201d Also, the nature of the Great War was that it involved little movement, often only glacial change in the positions of the front lines, which did not suit ambulance dogs that could be used primarily in finding the wounded after a battlefield was controlled. Richardson concedes that the \u201conly ambulance dogs that were used with any success were those with the German army when the Russians were retreating on the Eastern front.\u201d\n\n Richardson, Edwin Hautonville, 1863-   wrote &quot;British war dogs, their training and psychology&quot; [1920], <a href=\"http://archive.org/details/britishwardogsth00richrich\" rel=\"nofollow\">archive.org/details/britishwardogsth00richrich</a>\n\nElsewhere his middle name is spelled &quot;Hautenville&quot; and the title page of &quot;Forty Years with Dogs&quot; (found somewhere on eBay) has that spelling.\n\nSee also <a href=\"http://community-2.webtv.net/Hahn-50thAP-K9/K9History13/\" rel=\"nofollow\">community-2.webtv.net/Hahn-50thAP-K9/K9History13/</a>\n  A BIOGRAPHY OF  E.
