(Herbert) Ballantine.  Her husband (1864-1946) was a grandson of Peter Ballantine, who founded the famous brewery, Peter Ballantine &amp; Sons, in Newark, New Jersey .   After leaving the brewery business, he moved to the Neptune Meter Co. and became president.\nThere were two Mrs. John H. Ballantines.  He married the first , Lois Wilgus Ballantine, in 1890.  She died on December 24, 1919.  I'm guessing that is who is pictured here.\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=S5E-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1066&amp;lpg=PA1066&amp;dq=lois+wilgus+ballentine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L8PBMDl3o-&amp;sig=-RPZ_jqf8QkVHCPcfZcON9sEwss&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QVJiUN6VB6mOiALdzYHYDg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=lois wilgus ballentine&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=S5E-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1066&amp;...</a>\nThe second Mrs. B. was Gertrude Drake Ballantine (1869-1958).\n\nThere was a son, John Holme Ballantine, from the first marriage, born 1892.
