John and Will later argued over the recipe for the cereals (Will wanted to add sugar to the flakes). So in 1906, Will started his own company, the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, which eventually became the Kellogg Company, triggering a decades-long feud. John then formed the Battle Creek Food Company to develop and market soy  products.\n\nThe Kelloggs did not invent the concept of the dry breakfast cereal. That honor belongs to Dr. James Caleb Jackson, who created the first dry breakfast cereal in 1863, which he called, &quot;Granula.&quot; A patient of John's, Charles William Post, would eventually start his own dry cereal company, Post Cereals, selling a rival brand of corn flakes. Dr. Kellogg later would claim that Charles Post stole the formula for corn flakes from his safe in the Sanitarium office.", "authorname": "FreeRangeBob", "id": "8602872-4647770910-72157624052408245", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4647770910/#comment72157624177275388", "realname": "Wystan", "path_alias": null, "author": "70251312@N00", "iconserver": "3683", "datecreate": "1275352211", "_content": "Gerald Carson (1899-1989) told the whole convoluted story of the Kellogg brothers, their rise to fame, and their prickly relationship in his book, &quot;Cornflake Crusade&quot; (1957).
