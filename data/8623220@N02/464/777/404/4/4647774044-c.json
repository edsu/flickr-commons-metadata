S. Forest Service, and the 28th Govenor of Pennsylvania. He first checked into the Battle Creek Sanitarium in January, 1911.\n\nProhibitionist and Vegetarian Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, a Seventh-Day Adventist, was the eccentric dictator of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. (His brother, Will K. Kellogg, started the Kellogg's cereal company -- beginning with corn flakes -- as an offshoot of the Sanitarium's work in developing health foods. C. W. Post, a patient at the &quot;San,&quot; also liked the bland diet there, and became the multi-millionaire owner of the Post Cereals Company.)\n\nSamuel Sidney McClure (1857-1949) was the founder of the McClure Newspaper Syndicate and editor-publisher of McClure's Magazine, a muckraking organ of the Progressive movement, from 1893 to 1911. Through his magazine, McClure boosted recognition and acceptance of the early-childhood educational theories of Maria Montessori. &quot;He is a firm believer in the value of the low-protein diet, which he claims has doubled his ability for work and quadrupled his endurance. . . .&quot;\n\nIriving Fisher (1867-1947) was an American economist, health reformer, and eugenicist. When he contracted TB, he &quot;took the cure&quot; at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, and afterwards became a health reformer himself. He introduced the practice of calorie counting as part of a diet regimen. He was also a Prohibitionist: Prohibition of alcohol was a major tenet of the Seventh Day Adventists and of Dr. Kellogg's Sanitarium.\n\nSir H. Plunkett, Irish Unionist, had been for twenty years the Minister for Agriculture for Ireland. In Ireland, he promoted the ideals of the Battle Creek Sanitarium:\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=5KnhAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=sir+horace+plunkett+newell+dwight+hillis&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=5KnhAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq...</a>\n\nThis photo appears to have been taken in the sunny conservatory (Palm Garden) of the Battle Creek Sanitarium.\n\nThe building's exterior, in another Bain/LOC photo:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4647156705/]\n\nDr. John Harvey Kellogg, impresario of the &quot;San&quot;:\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4647770910/in/photostream/]", "authorname": "Wystan", "id": "8602872-4647774044-72157624031103963", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4647774044/#comment72157624156355406", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "34515493@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1275084126", "_content": "Pinchot's papers are at the Library of Congress.
