With the Ayrshire town of Girvan being only ten miles east of the Craig, some local boat owners offer trips around the rock. Granite was once quarried here to make <a href=\"http://www.kaysofscotland.co.uk/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">curling stones</a>. (All curling stones for the Olympic Games have come from this quarry.)\n\n&quot;There is a lighthouse on the east coast facing the mainland and a ruined keep of uncertain origins perched on the hillside above.\n\n&quot;Today the island is known locally as <i>Paddy's Milestone</i> as it approximately marks the halfway point of the sea journey from Belfast to Glasgow, a traditional route of emigration for many Irish labourers coming to Scotland to seek work.\n\n&quot;Ailsa Craig is now uninhabited, the lighthouse having been automated in 1990 and the quarry long since disused. The island is now a bird sanctuary, and huge numbers of gannets nest here ... and a growing number of puffins are choosing to return to the Craig from nearby Glunimore and Sheep Islands.&quot;<i>&mdash;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ailsa_Craig\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a></i>\n\n<i>Click images to view close-ups from other Flickr members:</i>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ayrshireroots/2981848810/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/3051/2981848810_1910dda9a7_t.jpg\" alt=\"Ailsa Craig Fog Horn\" alt=\"Ailsa Craig Fog Horn by ayrshireroots\" /></a> &nbsp;   &nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/gordontour/286993375/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/118/286993375_3eb4cbce4a_t.jpg\" alt=\"Tower\" alt=\"Tower by gordontour\" /></a> &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootpainter/118836031/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/48/118836031_f32ec99ec0_t.jpg\" alt=\"curl 9\" alt=\"curl 9 by bootpainter\" /></a> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brian_digital/253935570/\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/96/253935570_7fcd231413_t.jpg\" alt=\"Puffins on Rocks\" alt=\"Puffins on Rocks by brian_digital\" /></a>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Fog Horn&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Tower&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Curling Stone Quarry&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Puffins&quot;\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "8602872-3450361532-72157616954598262", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3450361532/#comment72157616878343355", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pollypocket44", "author": "36062129@N03", "iconserver": "3360", "datecreate": "1240033204", "_content": "I remember this rock from my childhood...You could see it from Irvine beach...", "authorname": "pollypocket44", "id": "8602872-3450361532-72157616878343355", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3450361532/#comment72157616897043411", "realname": "", "path_alias": "atomicjeep", "author": "36521966221@N01", "iconserver": "5467", "datecreate": "1240074264", "_content": "The other side:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/atomicjeep/205117540/\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/95/205117540_707458c803.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" alt=\"Ailsa Craig\" /></a>", "authorname": "atomicjeep", "id": "8602872-3450361532-72157616897043411", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3450361532/#comment72157617395159174", "realname": "", "path_alias": "wakitu", "author": "79177377@N00", "iconserver": "10", "datecreate": "1240855370", "_content": "Thank you, Pixel Wrangler and atomicjeep!", "authorname": "wakitu", "id": "8602872-3450361532-72157617395159174", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3450361532/#comment72157618560287221", "realname": "Jei Tootle", "path_alias": "jei2046", "author": "94261342@N00", "iconserver": "2876", "datecreate": "1243034971", "_content": "Wonderful shot.", "authorname": "jeitootle", "id": "8602872-3450361532-72157618560287221", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3450361532/#comment72157627491461838", "realname": "", "path_alias": "honey_g", "author": "65532804@N05", "iconserver": "8094", "datecreate": "1314012874", "_content": "Wow!", "authorname": "late2lense", "id": "8602872-3450361532-72157627491461838", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3450361532/#comment72157630303922796", "realname": "Sonia Crawford", "path_alias": "soniacraw", "author": "80025984@N02", "iconserver": "3737", "datecreate": "1340745901", "_content": "beautiful photo", "authorname": "soniacraw", "id": "8602872-3450361532-72157630303922796", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3450361532/#comment72157636879385655", "realname": "Stephen Coles", "path_alias": "stewf", "author": "23806189@N00", "iconserver": "7419", "datecreate": "1382560432", "_content": "<a href=\"http://fontsinuse.com/uses/5011/preguicoso-postcard\" rel=\"nofollow\">fontsinuse.com/uses/5011/preguicoso-postcard</a>", "authorname": "Stewf", "id": "8602872-3450361532-72157636879385655", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "3450361532"}}
