Sounds like an interesting guy.  \n\nJoseph Hertz was born in Rebrin, Hungary (now Slovakia), and emigrated to New York City in 1884. He was educated at New York City College (BA), Columbia University (PhD) and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (Rabbi, 1894, the Seminary's first graduate). His first Ministerial post was at Syracuse, New York.\n\nIn 1898, he moved to South Africa (Transvaal), to the Witwatersrand Old Hebrew Congregation, Johannesburg. He stayed there until 1911, despite attempts by President Paul Kruger in 1899 to expel him for his pro-British sympathies and for advocating the removal of religious disabilities of Jews and Catholics in South Africa. He was also Professor of Philosophy at Transvaal University College (later known as the University of the Witwatersrand), 1906-8. In 1911, he returned to New York to the Orach Chayim Congregation.\n\n==Chief Rabbi==In 1913, Rabbi Hertz was appointed Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Empire; his rival candidates had included Rabbi Moses Hyamson and Rabbi Bernard Drachman. Rabbi Hertz held the post until his death. His period in office was marked by many arguments with a wide variety of people, mainly within the Jewish community; the Dictionary of National Biography describes him as a &quot;combative Conservative&quot;. It was said of him that he was in favour of resolving disagreements by calm discussion - when all other methods had failed.", "authorname": "Cassies grandma", "id": "8602872-3102891076-72157611179795304", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3102891076/#comment72157611325015050", "realname": "", "path_alias": "victor98_2001", "author": "30444654@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1229434770", "_content": "best shot", "authorname": "victortan47", "id": "8602872-3102891076-72157611325015050", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3102891076/#comment72157613523002850", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "87387950@N00", "iconserver": "151", "datecreate": "1234137727", "_content": "From the description, he sounded like the kind of man who would argue 'till it...
