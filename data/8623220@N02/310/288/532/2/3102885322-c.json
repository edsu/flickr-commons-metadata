I can tell because building on the far right is the Engine Company 31 Firehouse (Napoleon Le Brun &amp; Sons, 1895). I have <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/epicharmus/3033518850/\">a current photo of it</a>; it looks nearly the same except for some roofing detail, but <a href=\"http://nyfd.com/engine_31/shannon_31.html\">a photo of the same corner from 1907</a> (scroll all the way down) shows the detailing intact. \n\nAnother bit of evidence: the street address for the firehouse is 87-91 Lafayette Street, while the signage on the corner building shows the number &quot;84&quot; (backwards), which is presumably part of its street address.\n\nAdditionally, <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=87-91+Lafayette+Street,+new+york,+ny&amp;fb=1&amp;cid=0,0,18143209619899108947&amp;ll=40.719063,-74.00131&amp;spn=0,359.980688&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.717941,-74.000963&amp;panoid=ZVoAMMCpK_-Ml79RKw0M2Q&amp;cbp=12,72.98126012818693,,0,-37.1666830007381\">according to Google Maps</a>, the tall building in the middle with the arched windows at the top is still standing--it's at Lafayette and Walker, a block away.\n\nI'm going to guess that Hartigan was rushing over to the New York State Supreme Court building (as per Mr. Angstrom above) a few blocks down south.", "authorname": "epicharmus", "id": "8602872-3102885322-72157611195308410", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/3102885322/#comment72157612302680093", "realname": "", "path_alias": "morvarid", "author": "29164467@N00", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1231496082", "_content": "breathtaking!
