They married in Geneva, Switzerland, and moved to China. They moved back to the United States in 1912, having judged it too unsafe due to the Chinese Revolution. In 1915, Straight, his wife and Herbert Croly began the publication of The New Republic, a weekly political magazine.&quot;\n\nStraight died in 1918.  In 1922 she gave his estate to Cornell to construct a building at Cornell University named after Willard Straight.
