In looking through  Prints and Photographs Division photographs that are not digitized, I was able to find another portrait of Mrs. Tinnin--same features (though the person who had recorded the copyright deposit photograph in 1913 wrote the name as &quot;Tinnan, Mrs. Glenda S.&quot;!).  I also found a photograph of Flora Wilson in Prints and Photographs Division files, and another portrait of her is featured in the Washington Post (March 5, 1909, p. 5).  Miss Wilson had a somewhat rounder face, less deep-set eyes, and differently shaped eyebrows.\n\nWhich is not to say that the labeling on the suffrage parade/pageant  photos is always accurate.
