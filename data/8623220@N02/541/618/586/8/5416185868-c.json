I would like to add to my previous statement.   Although, Marie Ganz was credited as having written Rebels in collaboration with Nat J Ferber, it should be noted that he was actually the biographer of her story.  She told him her story and he wrote it. Nat was a reporter for the New York American and as such he was aware of Marie since 1914 from her numerous causes Over time Nat and Marie got to know each other well.Knowing this Nat's editor Edward Leonard Bacon suggested that Nat write her story. The background to this story is well documented in Nat's Autobiography, &quot;I Found Out - A Confidential Chronicle of the Twenties.&quot;  Although, Nat and Marie fell in love Marie refused to give Hearst and the editors the satisfaction of a Happily ever after ending when she refused to marry Nat by print time.  She took exception to Hearst's addition of &quot;Into Anarchy and Out Again&quot; to the title &quot;Rebels.&quot;\n\nBTW: Alexander Berkman was called Sasha by his friends.", "authorname": "Debbie Bowie", "id": "8602872-5416185868-72157628801907141", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/5416185868/#comment72157628816294235", "realname": "Art Siegel", "path_alias": "artolog", "author": "76016463@N00", "iconserver": "3807", "datecreate": "1326242035", "_content": "<a href=\"http://cunews21.tumblr.com/new-york-homecoming-for-lenore-kahn\" rel=\"nofollow\">cunews21.tumblr.com/new-york-homecoming-for-lenore-kahn</a>\n\nA short piece on Lenore Kahn, daughter of Ganz and Ferber", "authorname": "artolog", "id": "8602872-5416185868-72157628816294235", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5416185868"}}
